    during sustained depolarization was converted from onset-only (normal, &#946;<sub>w</sub>&#8202;=&#8202;&#8722;21
    mV) to repetitive (neuropathic, &#946;<sub>w</sub>&#8202;=&#8202;&#8722;13 mV)
    by varying a single parameter. Onset-only spiking was observed in the neuropathic
    model but for only a narrow stimulus range. (<bold>B</bold>) According to bifurcation
    analysis in which stimulation (<italic>I</italic>

    <sub>stim</sub>) was systematically varied, repetitive spiking was produced by
    the neuropathic model when <italic>I</italic>

    <sub>stim</sub> exceeded a critical value required for a subcritical Hopf bifurcation.
    In contrast, the normal model did not undergo a bifurcation, which means spiking
    was limited to single spikes generated through a QS-crossing (see below). Generation
    of a single spike does not constitute a change in steady-state behavior, consistent
    with the absence of a bifurcation. (<bold>C</bold>) Phase planes show the fast
    activation variable <italic>V</italic> plotted against the slower recovery variable
    <italic>w</italic>. Nullclines (color) indicate where <italic>V</italic> or <italic>w</italic>
    do not change. Excitatory stimulation shifts the <italic>V</italic>-nullcline
    upward without affecting the <italic>w</italic>-nullcline. In the neuropathic
    model, <italic>V</italic>- and <italic>w</italic>-nullclines intersect at a stable
    (<italic>s</italic>) fixed point prior to stimulation, but that point becomes
    unstable (<italic>u</italic>) during stimulation &#8211; this corresponds to a
    Hopf bifurcation and is responsible for repetitive spiking. In the normal model,
    the fixed point remains stable during stimulation despite the <italic>V</italic>-nullcline
    shifting upward, but a single spike can nonetheless be generated depending on
    how the system moves to the newly positioned fixed point. The trajectory can be
    predicted by reference to a quasi-separatrix (QS), which corresponds to a manifold
    in phase space from which trajectories diverge. Quasi-separatrices were plotted
    here by integrating with a negative time step with initial values indicated by
    * on the phase planes (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). Like
    the <italic>V</italic>-nullcline, the QS shifts instantaneously with stimulation.
    If, as shown, the original fixed point ends up below the shifted QS, the trajectory
    to the newly positioned fixed point must follow an indirect route around the end
    of the QS (*), thus producing a spike; a more direct, subthreshold route would
    require the trajectory to cross back over the QS, which is not possible. If the
    original fixed point remained above the shifted QS, the trajectory would follow
    a direct route and no spike would be produced (not illustrated).</p>'
