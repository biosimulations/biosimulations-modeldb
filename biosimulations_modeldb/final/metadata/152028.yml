    different stimulus frequencies. Lambda scale bar shows one length constant, at
    which voltage changes to about 37% of its initial value. For a step input (0 Hz),
    the length constant was several times larger than the arbor size, meaning voltages
    will travel across the arbor unimpeded. At a higher input frequency of 100 Hz,
    the span across the morphology was larger than one electrotonic length. (<bold>D</bold>)
    Ionic-like currents were simulated on the passive morphology by varying current
    injection location and responses were recorded holding the soma in voltage clamp

    Simulating voltage clamp (VC) to 0 mV at the soma and observing voltage distribution
    over the morphology reflected effects of different Ks channel distributions, whose
    locations were indicated with red on the schematic in the insets. <bold>i</bold>.
    When a large Ks channel density of <italic>G</italic>

    <sub>Ks</sub> = 30 mS/cm<sup>2</sup> was applied uniformly to the cell (total
    <italic>g</italic>

    <sub>Ks</sub> &#8771; 1<italic>&#956;</italic>S, slightly larger than the two-compartment
    model total <italic>g</italic>

    <sub>Ks</sub> = 700 <italic>nS</italic>), VC affected only the soma. <bold>ii</bold>.
    The voltage could spread through the rest of the cell only when Ks density was

    and standard error of voltage change with input current (I-V curve) between aCC
    and RP2 motoneurons were similar (top). Slopes of the individual data points in
    the I-V curves (showing input conductance) were also similar (bottom; using markers
