  Clancy CE, Rudy Y. Cellular consequences of HERG mutations in the long QT \nsyndrome:precursors\
  \ to sudden cardiac death. Cardiovasc Res 2001;50:301-313.\n\nAbstract:\nBACKGROUND:\
  \ A variety of mutations in HERG, the major subunit of the rapidly \nactivating\
  \ component of the cardiac delayed rectifier I(Kr), have been found\nto underlie\
  \ the congenital Long-QT syndrome, LQT2. LQT2 may give rise to \nsevere arrhythmogenic\
  \ phenotypes leading to sudden cardiac death.\nOBJECTIVE: We attempt to elucidate\
  \ the mechanisms by which heterogeneous LQT2\ngenotypes can lead to prolongation\
  \ of the action potential duration (APD) \nand consequently the QT interval on the\
  \ ECG. \nMETHODS: We develop Markovian models of wild-type (WT) and mutant I(Kr)\n\
  channels and incorporate these models into a comprehensive model of the \ncardiac\
  \ ventricular cell. RESULTS: Using this virtual transgenic cell model, \nwe describe\
  \ the effects of HERG mutations on the cardiac ventricular action\npotential (AP)\
  \ and provide insight into the mechanism by which each defect \nresults in a net\
  \ loss of repolarizing current and prolongation of APD.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study\
  \ demonstrates which mutations can prolong APD\nsufficiently to generate early afterdepolarizations\
  \ (EADs), which may trigger\nlife-threatening arrhythmias. The severity of the phenotype\
  \ is shown to \ndepend on the specific kinetic changes and how they affect I(Kr)\
  \ during the\ntime course of the action potential. Clarifying how defects in HERG\
  \ can lead\nto impaired cellular electrophysiology can improve our understanding\
  \ of the \nlink between channel structure and cellular function.\n-------------------------------------\n\

  To run the models:\nXPP: start with the command\n\nxppaut IERG\\_Mar.ode\n\nMouse\
  \ click on Initialconds, and then (G)o.\nThis makes a trace similar to fig 4B (0mV)\
  \ of the paper.\nTo obtain the other traces in figure 4B you can press\nthe Param\
  \ button on the top of the XPP screen. Enter\na new vtest (e.g. one of -30, -20,\
  \ ... 30, 40) and click\nGo.\n\nTo run as a series of voltage-clamp studies, click\
  \ Range over, \nchange to 'vtest', \nand then select voltage protocol from \nSteps\
  \ (8) , Start (-30) and End (40).\n\nRegarding xpp program, please contact with\
  \ \nBard Ermentrout's website http://www.pitt.edu/~phase/\ndescribes how to get\
