    activated by pre-synaptic stimulation. Calcium (from glutamate activation of NMDA
    receptors) binds to Calmodulin (CaM). Calcium-calmodulin can bind to and activate
    protein phosphatase 2B (PP2B), adenylyl cyclase types 1 and 8 (AC), phosphodiesterase
    type 1B (PDE1B), or CaMKII. Gs-coupled receptors, such as dopamine D1 and &#946;-adrenergic
    receptors, synergistically activate adenylyl cyclase, which produces cAMP, which
    binds to PKA. Two types of phosphodiesterase (PDE1B and PDE4) degrade cAMP leading
    to PKA de-activation. Active PKA phosphorylates inhibitor-1 (I1), which then binds
    to and inhibits protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). CaMKII can autophosphorylate itself,
    and is dephosphorylated by PP1. (B) Stimulation protocols used for induction of
    L-LTP in the model. A single Ca<sup>2+</sup> pulse rises instantaneously to an
    amplitude of 0.7 &#181;M and decays with a time constant of 0.14 sec. Summation
    of Ca<sup>2+</sup> pulses in the train gives a maximum elevation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>
    of &#8764;10 &#181;M (top panel). A spaced pattern consisted of four 100 Hz trains
    (each 1 sec duration and fixed total number of pulses (400)) with an inter-train
    interval of 300 sec. The massed pattern provides the same four 100 Hz trains,
    but with an inter-train interval of 3 sec. Time intervals shown are not to scale.
    (C) Simulated time course of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and dopamine input for a single 1
    sec train of synaptic input at 100 Hz with the magnitude of 10 &#181;M and 1 &#181;M
    respectively.</p>

    temporal patterns of stimulation. A1 shows 1400 sec of simulation time and A2
    shows the first 200 sec to better show the four trains of massed stimulation.
    Though the peak is 1.4 times greater for massed trains, the cumulative activity
    of PKA activity is &#8764;60% greater for spaced trains (2321 nM-sec versus 1455
    nM-sec). (B) The increase in phosphoCaMKII activity (sum of Ca<sub>4</sub>-calmodulin
    trapped and autonomous forms) is smaller for spaced than massed stimulations.
    The positive feedback loop is visible in the spaced case, in which increments
    of phosphorylated CaMKII increase with subsequent trains. (C) Cumulative PKA activity
    (measured as area under the curve) shows an exponential increase (&#964;&#8202;=&#8202;8.5
    sec) as inter-train interval is increased. The peak phosphoCaMKII decreases exponentially
    with temporal interval, exhibiting a frequency sensitivity opposite to that of
    PKA. The time constant of the decrease, &#964;, is 20.8 sec. The sum of the normalized
    kinase activity (divided by two for graphical purposes) is constant for inter-train
    intervals greater than 3 sec, suggesting that the increase in PKA is compensating
    for a phosphoCaMKII deficit with larger for inter-train intervals.</p>

    begins to saturate with the first train, leading to sublinear summation of adenylyl
    cyclase activity in response to subsequent trains; (B) cAMP concentration exhibits
    sub-linear summation with massed stimuli; thus less cAMP is produced with massed
    than with spaced trains. (C) Depletion of adenylyl cyclase and calmodulin contribute
    to the non-linear summation. Fractions of unbound adenylyl cyclase 1 and calmodulin
    are much lower for the second stimulus train for massed stimulation (C1), but
    not for spaced stimulation (C2). Dashed horizontal line allows comparison of unbound
    calmodulin between first and second train. Dotted horizontal line allows comparison

    are caused by the initial decrease of phosphorylated inhibitor-1. These transient
    increases are followed by longer periods of decrease in free protein phosphatase
    1 below basal level, caused by an increase of phosphorylated inhibitor-1. This
