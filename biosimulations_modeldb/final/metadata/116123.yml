  \ \nAbstract: Transduction of graded synaptic input into trains of\nall-or-none\
  \ action potentials (spikes) is a crucial step in neural\ncoding. Hodgkin identified\
  \ three classes of neurons with\nqualitatively different analogue-to-digital transduction\
  \ properties.\nDespite widespread use of this classification scheme, a generalizable\n\
  explanation of its biophysical basis has not been described. We\nrecorded from spinal\
  \ sensory neurons representing each class and\nreproduced their transduction properties\
  \ in a minimal model. Using\nphase plane and bifurcation analysis, each class of\
  \ excitability was\nshown to derive from distinct spike initiating dynamics. Excitability\n\
  could be converted between all three classes by varying single\nparameters; moreover,\
  \ several parameters, when varied one at a time,\nhad functionally equivalent effects\
  \ on excitability. From this, we\nconclude that the spike initiating dynamics associated\
  \ with each of\nHodgkin's classes represent different outcomes in a nonlinear\n\
  competition between oppositely directed, kinetically mismatched\ncurrents. Class\
  \ 1 excitability occurs through a saddle-node on\ninvariant circle bifurcation when\
  \ net current at perithreshold\npotentials is inward (depolarizing) at steady state.\
  \ Class 2\nexcitability occurs through a Hopf bifurcation when, despite net\ncurrent\
  \ being outward (hyperpolarizing) at steady state, spike\ninitiation occurs because\
  \ inward current activates faster than outward\ncurrent. Class 3 excitability occurs\
  \ through a\nquasi-separatrix-crossing when fast-activating inward current\noverpowers\
  \ slow-activating outward current during a stimulus\ntransient, although slow-activating\
  \ outward current dominates during\nconstant stimulation. Experiments confirmed\
  \ that different classes of\nspinal lamina I neurons express the subthreshold currents\
  \ predicted by\nour simulations and, further, that those currents are necessary\
  \ for\nthe excitability in each cell class. Thus, our results demonstrate\nthat\
  \ all three classes of excitability arise from a continuum in the\ndirection and\
  \ magnitude of subthreshold currents. Through detailed\nanalysis of the spike initiating\
  \ process, we have explained a\nfundamental link between biophysical properties\
  \ and qualitative\ndifferences in how neurons encode sensory input.\n\n\nModel Notes:\n\
  \nModels demonstrate how action potentials can be generated through\ndifferent dynamical\
  \ mechanisms depending on the direction and\nmagnitude of subthreshold current.\
  \ We start with a two-dimensional\nMorris-Lecar-type model. Varying parameter Beta\\\
  _w causes this model to\nexhibit class 1, 2, or 3 excitability according to Hodgkin's\
  \ 1948\nclassification (see Figure 1 in paper). In this, the simplest model,\ndynamical\
  \ systems analysis shows that each class is associated with a\ndifferent spike initiating\
  \ mechanism (see Figure 2 in paper). Try\nvarying Beta\\_w to see how it affects\
  \ dynamics visualized on the V-w\nplane.\n\nTo increase the biological realism of\
  \ the model, we split the recovery\nvariable (w) into two parts (y and z) which\
  \ each control slightly\ndifferent currents (see Figure 4 in paper). Try varying\
  \ gsub and\nVsub.\n\nNoise is not included in these models but can be added by following\n\
  the notes included in the code. The code contains numerous other\ncomments that\
  \ will help explain the model.\n\nFor more information about XPP, visit\n<http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/XPPAUT>\

    thereby allowing the neuron to spike slowly, hence the continuous

    the newly positioned fixed point: a single spike is initiated when

    stimulation instantaneously displaces the quasi-separatrix (dotted

    curves) so that the system, which existed above the (red)

    <sub>fast</sub>, meaning slow

    negative feedback keeps <italic>V</italic> from increasing high enough

    to initiate fast positive feedback <italic>at steady state</italic>.

    Fast positive feedback (that results in a spike) can be initiated only

    if the system is perturbed from steady state. Quasi-separatrix (blue)

    has a region of negative slope (*) indicating where net positive

    feedback occurs given the kinetic difference between fast and slow

    currents: positive feedback that activates rapidly can compete

    effectively with stronger negative feedback whose full activation is

    delayed by its slower kinetics. If <italic>V</italic> is forced rapidly

    past the blue arrowhead, fast positive feedback initiates a single spike

    before slow negative feedback catches up and forces the system back to

    its stable fixed point. Quasi-separatrix is plotted as the sum of all

    currents but with <italic>I</italic>

    <sub>slow</sub> calculated as a

    function of <italic>w</italic> at the quasi-separatrix (see phase plane

    in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000198-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) rather

    than at steady state and is shown here for

    <italic>I</italic>

    &#181;A/cm<sup>2</sup>. Class 2 neuron:

    <italic>I</italic>

    <sub>slow</sub> and

    <italic>I</italic>

    <sub>fast</sub> activate at roughly the same

    <italic>V</italic>. A Hopf bifurcation occurs at the point indicated by

    the arrow, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000198.e003.jpg"
    mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref>).

    This means that fast positive feedback exceeds slow negative feedback at

    steady state; as for class 3 neurons, this relies on positive feedback

    having fast kinetics since the net perithreshold current is still

    outward (i.e., steady state <italic>I&#8211;V</italic> curve is

    monotonic). Note that the slope of the steady-state

    <italic>I&#8211;V</italic> curve is less steep in the class 2

    model than in the class 3 model. Class 1 neuron:

    <italic>I</italic>

    <sub>slow</sub> activates at higher

    <italic>V</italic> than <italic>I</italic>

    <sub>fast</sub>, meaning slow

    negative feedback does not begin activating until after the spike is

    initiated. This gives a steady state

    <italic>I</italic>&#8211;<italic>V</italic> curve that is

    non-monotonic with a region of negative slope (*) near the apex

    of the instantaneous <italic>I</italic>&#8211;<italic>V</italic>

    curve. The SNIC bifurcation occurs when

    &#8706;<italic>I</italic>

    <sub>ss</sub>/&#8706;<italic>t</italic>&#8202;=&#8202;0

    (arrowhead) because, at this voltage, <italic>I</italic>

    <sub>fast</sub>

    counterbalances <italic>I</italic>

    <sub>leak</sub> and any further

    depolarization will cause progressive activation of

    <italic>I</italic>

    <sub>fast</sub>. (B) Changing

    <italic>&#7713;</italic>

    <sub>fast</sub> in the 2D model had

    equivalent effects on the shape of the steady state

    <italic>I&#8211;V</italic> curves. Unlike in (A), voltage at the

    apex of the instantaneous

    <italic>I</italic>&#8211;<italic>V</italic> curve (purple arrows)

    changes as <italic>&#7713;</italic>

    <sub>fast</sub> is varied; in

    other words, the net current at perithreshold potentials can be

    modulated by changing fast currents (which directly impact voltage

    threshold) rather than by changing the amplitude or voltage-dependency

    of slow currents. This is consistent with results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000198-g008">Figure
    8</xref>. (C) Speeding

    of class 2 and 3 excitability. Compared with original model

    outward at steady state, fast-activating inward current ensures repetitive

    spiking above a critical frequency; spiking cannot be sustained below a rate

    that would allow enough time for slow-activating outward current to activate

    sufficiently that net current becomes outward during the interspike

    strong that repetitive spiking is prohibited despite fast-activating inward

    current; spike generation is only possible when the system is perturbed from
