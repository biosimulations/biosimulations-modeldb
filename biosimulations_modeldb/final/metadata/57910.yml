  \ N, Rosati B, Arcangeli A, Olivotto M, Wanke E. A novel role \nfor HERG K+ channels:\
  \ spike-frequency adaptation. J Physiol 1997;501:313-318\n\nAbstract:\n1. The regular\
  \ firing of a Hodgkin-Huxley neurone endowed with fast Na+ \nand delayed K+ channels\
  \ can be converted into adapting firing by appending \nHERG (human eag-related gene)\
  \ channels. 2. The computer model predictions \nwere verified by studying the firing\
  \ properties of F-11 DRG neurone x \nneuroblastoma hybrid cells induced to differentiate\
  \ by long- term exposure \nto retinoic acid. These cells, which express HERG currents\
  \ (IHERG), show \nclear spike-frequency adaptation of their firing when current\
  \ clamped with \nlong depolarizations. 3. In agreement with the prediction, the\
  \ selective \nblocking of IHERG by class III antiarrhythmic drugs always led to\
  \ the \ndisappearance of the spike- frequency adaptation, and the conversion of\
  \ \nadapting firing to regular firing. 4. It is proposed that, in addition to their\
  \ \nrole in the repolarization of the heart action potential, HERG channels may\
  \ \nsustain a process of spike-frequency adaptation, and hence contribute to the\
  \ \ncontrol of burst duration in a way that is similar to that of the K+ currents,\
  \ \nIAHP, IC and IM. In addition to the known cardiac arrhythmia syndrome \n(LQT2),\
  \ genetic mutations or an altered HERG expression could lead to \ncontinuous hyperexcitable\
  \ states sustained by the inability of nerve or endocrine \ncells to accommodate\
  \ to repetitive stimuli. This might help in clarifying the \npathogenesis of still\
  \ undefined idiopathic familial epilepsies. \n---\n\nTo run the models:\nXPP: start\

  \ (G)o.\nThis makes a trace similar to fig 1E of the paper.\n\nRegarding xpp program,\
