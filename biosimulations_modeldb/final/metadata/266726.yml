    of sesamine (SSM) on voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> currents (<italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub>)
    in pituitary GH<sub>3</sub> cells. The whole-cell recordings were undertaken in
    cells bathed in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free Tyrode&#8217;s solution containing 10 mM
    tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA) and the patch pipette was filled with K<sup>+</sup>-containing
    solution. (<bold>A</bold>) Representative <italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub> traces

    effects of SSM on the peak and sustained components of <italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub>.
    <italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub> was evoked by abrupt depolarization from &#8722;80
    to &#8722;10 mV. Current amplitudes obtained during cell exposure to different
    concentrations (0.1&#8211;100 &#956;M) of SSM were measured at the beginning (&#9675;,
    peak <italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub>) and end (&#9632;, sustained <italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub>),
    evoked by depolarizing voltage. Each point presented in the figure depicts the
    mean &#177; standard error of the mean (SEM, n = 9&#8211;12). The values of IC<sub>50</sub>
    and n<sub>H</sub> for SSM-induced inhibition of sustained <italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub>
    were calculated to be 0.6 &#956;M and 1.2, respectively, whereas those for peak
    <italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub> were 7.2 &#956;M and 1.2, respectively. The vertical
    dashed line indicates the IC<sub>50</sub> value required for SSM-perturbed inhibition
    of peak or sustained <italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub> amplitude. Of note, the SSM
    addition is capable of differentially and concentration-dependently decreasing
    the amplitude of peak and sustained <italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub> in GH<sub>3</sub>
    cells, without any modifications to the Hill coefficient of the curve. (<bold>C</bold>)

    fits of the slow component of <italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub> inactivation (&#964;<sub>inact(S)</sub>)
    was constructed and plotted against the different concentrations of SSM applied.
    Data points were well fitted to a linear regression, reflecting that SSM-perturbed
    blocking occurs with a molecularity of 1. (<bold>D</bold>) Average <italic>I-V</italic>

    of peak <italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub> in the absence and presence of SSM was

    simulations of the SSM-mediated inhibition of voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> currents
    (<italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub>). The state diagram of a Markovian model for
    the Na<sub>V</sub> channel (i.e., <italic>SCN8A</italic> channel) depicted in
    (<bold>A</bold>) was adopted from a recent study [<xref rid="B42-molecules-25-03062"
    ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The solutions to the ordinary differential equations
    in the current study were implemented in the XPP software package, and the default
    values for detailed numerical parameters are identical to those demonstrated previously
    [<xref rid="B42-molecules-25-03062" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], except that the
    values of &#949; (i.e., voltage-independent transition rate from the open to blocked
    state) and maximal conductance of <italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub> in the control
    (i.e., SSM was not present) were arbitrarily assigned to be 0.3 msec<sup>&#8722;1</sup>
    and 3.6 nS, respectively. In (<bold>A</bold>), C: closed state; O: open state;
    OB: blocked state; I: inactivated state. Oon and Ooff represent the on and off
    transition rates for the normal inactivation of Na<sub>V</sub> channels from the
    open (O) state, respectively, and are independent of voltage, while Con and Coff
    are the on and off rates for normal inactivation from the C1&#8211;C5 states and
    is also independent of voltage. a = (Oon/Con)<sup>1/4</sup> and b = (Ooff/Coff)<sup>1/4</sup>.
    In (<bold>B</bold>), the model cell was abruptly depolarized from &#8722;80 to
    &#8722;10 mV, then repolarized to -50 mV (as indicated in the inset). When the
    value of Oon was raised to 3.5 msec<sup>&#8722;1</sup> (b) or 4.6 msec<sup>&#8722;1</sup>
    (c) from a control value of 2.3 msec<sup>&#8722;1</sup> (a), and the value of
    maximal conductance was simultaneously reduced to 2.7 nS (b) or 1.8 nS (c) from
    a control value of 3.6 nS (a), there was a noticeable reduction in the peak amplitude
    of simulated <italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub> in combination with the slowed inactivation
    time constant of the current. Trace (a) is the control, and those labeled (b)
    and (c) were created to mimic the inhibitory effect of 0.3 and 1 &#956;M SSM on

    and in the presence of 0.3 and 1 &#956;M SSM. Of note, in the presence of SSM,
