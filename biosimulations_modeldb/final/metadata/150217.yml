  The XPP code was run and set with MATLAB (using file runchange.m),

  using the MATLAB-XPP interface that can be downloaded here:

  <http://www2.gsu.edu/~matrhc/XPP-Matlab.html>


  There were five sets of simulations

  1 The original Prescott model: prescott

  2 Model with added T-current: prescott + T

  3 Model with added T-current and adaptation current: prescott + T+adap

  4 Model with added T-current and h-current: prescott + T+h

  5 Model with added T-current with variable gT: prescott+Tvar


  All used the same input stimulus, taken from the experiments, stim.tab
