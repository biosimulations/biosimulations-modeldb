    xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">When a signal travels from the
    right to the left neuron along the axon, glutamate is released at the dendritic
    terminals. The terminals are separated from the neighboring neuron by the synaptic
    cleft. Signal transmission goes via release of the neurotransmitter glutamate.
    It binds to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron and can initiate new action potentials.
    The synaptic terminals are located at the dendrites of the receiving neuron. At
    the same time the right neuron can receive glutamate&#8211;mediated signals from
    other neurons through the dendritic terminals located near its own soma. The inset
    on the left shows additional details: glutamate is contained in vesicles and in
    the release process all molecules are released into the cleft at once. The inset
    on the right shows idealized geometry of the synapse considered in the model.</p>'

    The figure shows all the familiar aspects of SD. In <bold>(a)</bold> and <bold>(b)</bold>
    the neuron depolarizes and the differences between Nernst potentials become very
    small. Depolarization is maintained for about 70 sec and ends with an abrupt repolarization
    drop after which the Nernst potentials slowly return to their initial values.
    Changes in ion concentrations in <bold>(c)</bold> and <bold>(d)</bold> correspond
    to the evolution of the potentials. There is, for example, a huge increase in
    extracellular K<sup>+</sup> and a huge drop in extracellular Na<sup>+</sup>. The
    ion fluxes induce swelling of the glia cell and the neuron (see the insets), which
    result in shrinkage of the ECS. The time of de&#8211; and repolarization are marked
    by a red upward pointing and a green downward pointing triangle. These symbols
    will be used in the following figures to indicate these events.</p>

    <bold>(a)</bold> and <bold>(b)</bold> show a jump of the cleft glutamate concentration
    to about 15 mM when the neuron depolarizes. In the simulation of K<sup>+</sup>
    perfusion we assume intact glutamate uptake at all times, and the high cleft concentration
    is brought back to a much lower level within 2 sec (see upper inset of <bold>(a)</bold>).
    There is a plateau concentration near 0.01 mM that is maintained as long as the
    neuron is depolarized, and is only cleared after repolarization (lower inset of
    <bold>(a)</bold>). There is no noticeable glutamate elevation in the ECS. In panel
    <bold>(b)</bold> we see different dynamics, because there is no glutamate clearance
    during OGD. The sharp jump in the cleft concentration also decays within 2 sec,
    but the concentration then settles to a much higher level of 5 mM (see upper inset).
    It keeps increasing slowly until glutamate clearance is slowly reactivated (see
    horizontal bar for the OGD protocol). The lower inset shows that glutamate is
    back to a very low level before the neuron repolarizes. The extracellular concentration
    goes up to more than 5 mM. When there is no glutamate clearance at all (center
    part of the OGD bar) the concentrations in the cleft and the ECS are equal because
    of diffusion. The lower panels show pathways of glutamate clearance. Glutamate
    that has been taken up from the cleft or the ECS by either the neuron or the glial
    cell, but has not yet been recycled, counts as buffered glutamate (see <xref ref-type="disp-formula"
    rid="pcbi.1005804.e046">Eq 30</xref>). The main plots show glutamate clearance
    from the cleft, the inset show clearance from the ECS. For K<sup>+</sup> perfusion,
    more glutamate is cleared directly from the cleft than from the ECS (see peak
    values in the main plot and inset of panel <bold>(c)</bold>). In the cleft, more
    glutamate is cleared by glia than by the neuron (compare the orange and the yellow
    portion of the total uptake from the cleft). In the ECS, this relation is even
    more pronounced (compare turquoise to blue in the second inset). In panel <bold>(d)</bold>,
    glutamate clearance only sets in with the reactivation of regulatory functions
    at the end of the OGD protocol. Now more glutamate is cleared from the ECS, since
    there is more in the ECS than in the clefts. The relation between uptake by glia
    and neural uptake is consistent with <bold>(c)</bold> and Eqs <xref ref-type="disp-formula"
