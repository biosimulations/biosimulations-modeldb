  synchronization of rhythmically-firing dendritic neurons.

  J Neurophysiol Sep 6; [Epub ahead of print]


  Note from Dr Goldberg:


  I apologize for not having code that executes each figure, but truly

  all the information is in the paper. I hope the names are self

  explanatory. The simulations of pairs of neurons that appear in the

  paper require VERY VERY long times to reach steady state, as the

  coupling is very weak in the case of dendritic coupling.  One final

  comment, although in figure 2 the dendrite/cable is passive the code

  includes an NaP current in the cable, but if the conductance gnad is

  set to zero the cable becomes passive.
