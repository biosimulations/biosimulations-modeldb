  The .ode files run with XPP.


  The .c file is in C and uses headers and the rk4 routine from

  Numerical Recipies.


  The parameters that recreate the subplots of Figure 4 are shown using

  XPP in a collection of jpgs included in this archive. Note that the

  XPP code is written so as to measure time in milliseconds.


  The authors recommend that modelers use the more efficient C code,

  which outputs time in seconds, and which includes in the comments the

  parameter values used for all five burst types.


  Parameter values for all figures are also listed in the paper itself.'
