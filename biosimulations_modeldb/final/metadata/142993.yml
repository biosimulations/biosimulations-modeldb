  Ratte S, Prescott SA (2011) ClC-2 Channels Regulate Neuronal

  Excitability, Not Intracellular Chloride Levels J Neurosci

  These model files were supplied by Dr Steve Prescott.


  ClC2-VClamp-Prescott.ode implements simulations in voltage clamp.

  Data presented in Figure 1 of the paper can be reproduced using this

  model


  ClC2-IClamp-Prescott.ode implements simulations in current clamp.

  Data presented in Figures 2 and 3 of the paper can be reproduced using

  this model.


  The model is for a generic, single compartment neuron with multiple

  ion currents. The most notable mechanisms include ClC-2 (a rectifying

  chloride-leak channel) and KCC2 (potassium chloride co-transporter 2).

  A significant feature of the model is that it tracks intracellular

  chloride concentration. Moreover, the GABA-A receptor is modeled as

  passing both chloride and bicarbonate ions, which is important for

  proper calculation of the GABA reversal potential. Ornstein-Unlenbeck

  processes to simulate synaptic inhibition and excitation are also

  included.'
