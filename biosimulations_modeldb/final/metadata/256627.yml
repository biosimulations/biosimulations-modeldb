    bifurcation analysis, a parameter such as stimulus intensity <italic>I</italic><sub>stim</sub>
    is systematically varied to determine at what value the system qualitatively changes
    behavior, which is to say it undergoes a bifurcation. We repeated this analysis
    in a model with the <italic>&#7713;</italic><sub>Na</sub>:<italic>&#7713;</italic><sub>K</sub>
    ratio set to give normal excitability (<italic>&#7713;</italic><sub>Na</sub> =

    <italic>&#7713;</italic><sub>K</sub> = 2.0 &#181;S/cm<sup>2</sup>). Bifurcation
    diagrams (left) illustrate how the system behaves at different <italic>I</italic><sub>stim</sub>:
    a stable fixed point corresponds to quiescence whereas a stable limit cycle corresponds
    to repetitive spiking. A subcritical Hopf bifurcation is evident in the bottom
    (<italic>Neuropathic</italic>) bifurcation diagram but not in the top (<italic>Normal</italic>)
    bifurcation diagram, suggesting that repetitive spiking is only possible in the
    former condition. In both conditions, the <italic>I</italic><sub>stim</sub> range
    in which a single spike is produced at stimulus onset is indicated with gray shading.
    Onset-only spiking is achieved through a quasi-separatrix crossing, independent
    of any bifurcation. Dotted arrows indicate <italic>I</italic><sub>stim</sub> values
    for sample traces on the right. Membrane potential oscillations (MPOs) occur when
    the fixed point is in proximity to a Hopf bifurcation; after being perturbed by
    noise, the system relaxes towards its nearly-unstable fixed point following a
    loose spiral trajectory, which corresponds to MPOs on the time series. In the
    absence of a Hopf bifurcation, the fixed point is more stable and MPOs are negligible.
    Repetitive spiking occurs when <italic>I</italic><sub>stim</sub> exceeds the intensity
    required for the Hopf bifurcation. Repetitive spiking can also occur in the <italic>I</italic><sub>stim</sub>
    range between the Hopf bifurcation and where the stable and unstable limit cycles
    meet (at a saddle-node bifurcation of limit cycles); that region also contains
    a stable fixed point, meaning that the system is bistable. The neuron will remain
    in one or the other stable state unless a slow process like adaptation sweeps
    the system across the bistable region, in which case the neuron will remain quiescent
    when sweeping rightward toward the Hopf bifurcation, while spiking repetitively
    when sweeping leftward toward the saddle-node bifurcation of limit cycles, thereby
    producing bursts as a consequence of hysteresis. Bistability and adaptation are
    both required for bursting.</p><p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><bold>DOI:</bold>

    induces a larger change in membrane conductances. (<bold>C</bold>) Based on the
