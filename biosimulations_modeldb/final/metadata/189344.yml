description: "This is the readme for the models associated with the paper:\n\nHandy\
  \ G, Taheri M, White JA, Borisyuk A (2017) Mathematical\ninvestigation of IP3-dependent\
  \ calcium dynamics in astrocytes.\nJ Comput Neurosci\n\nThese MATLAB and XPP files\
  \ were contributed by G Handy.\n\nUse example_ca_sim_TH.m to reproduce calcium simulations\
  \ found in\nFig. 2 \n\nUse autoRespTypeDetection_TH.m to generate calcium responses\
  \ \nresulting from multiple (or all 600) underlying IP3 traces, as \nwell as characterize\
  \ those calcium and IP3 traces (in terms of, \nfor example, amplitude, total duration,\
  \ area under the curves, etc.).\n\nUse ca_bifurcation_xpp.ode with XPPAUT to reproduce\
  \ the bifurcation\ndiagrams found J. Computation Neuroscience (submitted)\n\nSupporting_Functions\
  \ contains all necessary functions to run the\nsimulations.\n\nHistogram_Figures\
  \ contains the data base of calcium response types\ndistributions for a range of\
  \ parameter values (original figures can be\nfound in J. Computation Neuroscience\
  \ (submitted))\n\nHopefully you have found this code helpful!\n\n--Marsa Taheri\
