  caption: <p>Schematic of the detailed mammalian circadian clock model. (<bold>A</bold>)
    Only some of the relevant species are shown. Circles refer to transcripts and
    squares are proteins, possibly in complex. Small circles refer to phosphorylation
    states that are color coded by the kinases that perform the phosphorylation. See
    section &#8216;Description of the detailed model' in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material"
    rid="S1">Supplementary information</xref> for details. (<bold>B</bold>) The detailed
    model consists of a core negative feedback loop and an additional negative feedback
    loop (the NNF structure). The repressors (PER1&#8211;2 and CRY1&#8211;2) inactivate
    the activators (BMALs and CLOCK/NPAS2) of their own transcription expression through
    the core negative feedback loop. The activators inactivate their own transcription
    expression by inducing the Rev-erbs through the secondary negative feedback loop.</p>

  caption: <p>Proper stoichiometry between activators and repressors is the key to
    sustained oscillations. (<bold>A</bold>) Our detailed mathematical model accurately
    predicts the phenotype of the known mutations in circadian genes (<xref ref-type="table"
    rid="t1">Table I</xref>). We plot the stoichiometry predicted by our model in
    these mutants with the relative amplitude of Per1 mRNA rhythms (or Per2 mRNA when
    considering the <italic>Per1</italic><sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup>). Here, an amplitude
    of zero means rhythms are not sustained. These results indicate that the phenotype
    of the mutants can be predicted by their effects on stoichiometry. (<bold>B</bold>)
    The stoichiometry between repressors and activators is changed by constitutively
    expressing either the Per2 gene or the Bmals and Clock genes at different levels.
    Note that the model is rhythmic only when the stoichiometry is near 1&#8211;1.
    The relative amplitude of the Per1 mRNA is measured. (<bold>C</bold>) Schematic
    of a simplified model based on the Goodwin oscillator. Instead of a Hill-type
    equation, the sequestration of the activator (<italic>A</italic>) by the repressor
    (<italic>P</italic>) is used to describe repression of the gene. (<bold>D</bold>)
    Oscillations are seen around a 1&#8211;1 stoichiometry as the level of activator
    is changed. The range of the stoichiometry widens as the dissociation constant
    (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) decreases or the binding between the activator
    and the repressor tightens.</p>

  caption: <p>The NNF structure maintains stoichiometry in balance by active compensation
    of both repressors and activators. (<bold>A</bold>) A negative or positive feedback
    controlling the activator is added to the original negative feedback controlling
    the repressor. (<bold>B</bold>) The relative sensitivity (% change in mean level
    of stoichiometry per % change in transcription rate of repressor) in the simple
    models with SNF, NNF and PNF structure were measured over a range of the transcription
    rates of repressor (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary
    Figure 4A</xref>). Then, we calculated the average of relative sensitivity over
    the range of parameters. On average, the relative sensitivity of the NNF model
    is about two-fold less sensitive than that of the SNF model, but that of the PNF
    model is about four-fold more sensitive than that of the SNF model (see <xref
    ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary information</xref> and
    <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 4A&#8211;C</xref>
    for details). (<bold>C</bold>) The detailed model matches data from Gene Dose
    Network Analysis experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Baggs et al, 2009</xref>).
    After the knockout of a repressor gene (here, <italic>Cry1</italic>), the activity
    of the repressor promoters, controlled by an E-box, increases. This increases
    the expression of Rev-Erbs and reduces the activity of the activator promoter,
    controlled by a RORE. An opposite phenotype is seen when an activator (here, <italic>Clock</italic>)
    is knocked out. The activity of E-box decreases. This decreases the expression
    of Rev-Erbs and increases the activity of RORE. This active compensation through
    the NNF structure allows the stoichiometry to be balanced after the repressors
    or activators knockout. (<bold>D</bold>) The detailed model matches data from
    <italic>Rev-erbs<sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Liu
    et al, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Bugge et al, 2012</xref>; <xref

    on the expression level of <italic>Per2</italic>, <italic>Cry1</italic> and <italic>Bmal1</italic>.
    Double knockout of the <italic>Rev-erb</italic>&#945; and <italic>Rev-erb</italic>&#946;
    (100% reduction of transcription rate of the <italic>Rev-erbs</italic>) increases
    the expression level of <italic>Bmal1</italic> and <italic>Cry1</italic>, but
    decreases that of <italic>Per2.</italic> All the values were normalized by the

  caption: <p>The NNF structure oscillates over the widest range of parameters. (<bold>A</bold>)
    The transcription rate of the repressor and the activator are changed from their
    initial value, and the range of parameters where the rhythms persist is shown.
    Here, dissociation constant, <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>=10<sup>&#8722;5</sup>
    and clearance rate of activator, &#948;=0.2. When <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>
    is varied, the NNF model still has the widest range of parameters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material"
    rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 5C</xref>). When &#948; increases, the range of

  caption: <p>A design suitable for the cellular clocks with a fixed period. (<bold>A</bold>)
    A single-negative feedback loop with an additional fast positive feedback loop,
    with which activator (<italic>A</italic>) activates itself and degrades quickly.
    This structure has been identified in various biological oscillators like the
    cell cycle and pacemaker in the sino-atrial node (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">Tsai
    et al, 2008</xref>). (<bold>B</bold>) A single-negative feedback loop with an
    additional slow negative feedback loop, with which activator (<italic>A</italic>)
    represses itself and degrades slowly. Circadian clocks in mammals or <italic>Drosophila</italic>
    have been shown to have this structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material"
    rid="S1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Blau and
    Young, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Benito et al, 2007</xref>;
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Liu et al, 2008</xref>). (<bold>C</bold>, <bold>D</bold>)
    The period of the NNF is nearly constant for the perturbations in transcription
    rates while the period of the PNF changes about two-fold. Parameters used are
    as in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 5C</xref>.
    The period is plotted as a color where green refers to the period with the unperturbed
    parameters.</p>
