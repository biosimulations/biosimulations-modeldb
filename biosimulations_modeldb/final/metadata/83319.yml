  vol 23, p 349-398, 2007\n\nAbstract:\n\nWe review different aspects of the simulation\
  \ of spiking neural\nnetworks.  We start by reviewing the different types of simulation\n\
  strategies and algorithms that are currently implemented.  We next\nreview the precision\
  \ of those simulation strategies, in particular\nin cases where plasticity depends\
  \ on the exact timing of the\nspikes.  We overview different simulators and simulation\n\
  environments presently available (restricted to those freely\navailable, open source\
  \ and documented).  For each simulation tool,\nits advantages and pitfalls are reviewed,\
  \ with an aim to allow the\nreader to identify which simulator is appropriate for\
  \ a given task.\nFinally, we provide a series of benchmark simulations of different\n\
  types of networks of spiking neurons, including Hodgkin-Huxley\ntype, integrate-and-fire\
  \ models, interacting with current-based or\nconductance-based synapses, using clock-driven\
  \ or event-driven\nintegration strategies.  The same set of models are implemented\
  \ on\nthe different simulators, and the codes are made available.  The\nultimate\
  \ goal of this review is to provide a resource to facilitate\nidentifying the appropriate\
  \ integration strategy and simulation\ntool to use for a given modeling problem\
  \ related to spiking neural\nnetworks.\n\n\nThe codes included in this package refer\
  \ to the benchmark\nsimulations described above.  The main goal is to provide a\
  \ series\nof benchmark simulations of networks of spiking neurons, and how\nthese\
  \ are implemented in the different simulators overviewed in the\npaper.  See details\
  \ in the enclosed file Appendix2.pdf, which\ndescribes these different benchmarks.\
  \  Some of these benchmarks\nwere based on the Vogels-Abbott model ([Vogels TP and\
  \ Abbott LF. \nSignal propagation and logic gating in networks of\nintegrate-and-fire\
  \ neurons. J. Neurosci. 25: 10786-10795, 2005](http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/full/25/46/10786)).\
