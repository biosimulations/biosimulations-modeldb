This is the readme for the model code associated with the publication:

Goldberg JA, Deister CA, Wilson CJ (2006) Response properties and
synchronization of rhythmically-firing dendritic neurons.
J Neurophysiol Sep 6; [Epub ahead of print]

Note from Dr Goldberg:

I apologize for not having code that executes each figure, but truly
all the information is in the paper. I hope the names are self
explanatory. The simulations of pairs of neurons that appear in the
paper require VERY VERY long times to reach steady state, as the
coupling is very weak in the case of dendritic coupling.  One final
comment, although in figure 2 the dendrite/cable is passive the code
includes an NaP current in the cable, but if the conductance gnad is
set to zero the cable becomes passive.
