This is the README file for the model associated with the paper:

Denizot, A., Arizono, M., NÃ¤gerl, V., Soula, H., Berry, H. (2019). Simulation of calcium signaling in fine astrocytic processes: effect of spatial properties on spontaneous activity. 


We present here 4 different implementations of the model, described below.


#####################
##### Gillespie #####
#####################
This model corresponds to the Gillespie implementation of the model. It has been developed in python. This model has been used in Figure 2.


#####################
######## ODE ########
#####################
This model corresponds to ODE model presented in Fig2 of the paper. It requires XPPAUT software, which is freely available at http://www.math.pitt.edu/~bard/xpp/xpp.html


######################
### Particle-based ###
######################
This model corresponds to the particle-based implementation of the model. It has been developed in C. This is the model used in Figures 2 to 5 of the paper.


#################
##### STEPS #####
#################
This model corresponds to the GCaMP6s model presented in Fig6 of the paper. It has been developed in python and requires STEPS software, which is freely available at http://steps.sourceforge.net/STEPS/default.php
