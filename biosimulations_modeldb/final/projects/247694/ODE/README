This is the README file for the ODE model associated with the paper:

Denizot, A., Arizono, M., NÃ¤gerl, V., Soula, H., Berry, H. (2019). Simulation of calcium signaling in fine astrocytic processes: effect of spatial properties on spontaneous activity. 

This model requires XPPAUT software, which is freely available at http://www.math.pitt.edu/~bard/xpp/xpp.html
This model corresponds to ODE model presented in Fig2 of the paper (see also Material & Methods section for more information on the different models developed).
