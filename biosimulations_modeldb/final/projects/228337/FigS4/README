This package contains the XPP scripts simulated for supplementary Figure 4.
Left-column figures represent the desensitization model (see Fig. 2 in main text),
right-column figures the activation model (see Fig. 3).

The following parameters were varied.

A the applied dose of TC-7020, expressed as peak concentration

B the efficacy of TC-7020 (reference ACh = 100 %)

C the position of the Hill-function for desensitization on the concentration axis,
  expressed as the factor by which the concentration for half-maximal desensitization 
  is shifted to the right

D compares the default model (blue) with the response after preadministration of 
  a PAM (positive allosteric modulator, prevents desensitization, green), 
  and the response for a PAM with 100 % intrinsic efficacy (such as 4BP-TQS).


The parameters can be varied by uncommenting the corresponding lines in the scripts,
or by using the parameter window to vary the following values (first value is default):

Aleft   dose_Aga7 = 0.3, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0
Aright  dose_Aga7 = 0.5, 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 2.0 (Note that the activation model uses a slower wash-out)

Bleft   w_actAga7 = 0.3, 0.1, 1.0, 2.0
Bright  w_actAga7 = 0.3, 0.1, 1.0

Cleft   IC50_Aga7 = 0.002, 0.004, 0.01, 0.1, 0.1 with C_ach 30
Cright  IC50_Aga7 = 0.002, 0.004, 0.01, 0.02, 0.1

D       P_a7 = act_a7 with w_actAga7 = 0.3 (green) or w_actAga7 = 1.0 (red)
