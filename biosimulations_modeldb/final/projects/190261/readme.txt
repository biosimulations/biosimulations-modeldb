This is the readme for the models associated with the paper:

Rho YA, Prescott SA (2012) Identification of molecular pathologies
sufficient to cause neuropathic excitability in primary somatosensory
afferents using dynamical systems theory. PLoS Comput Biol 8:e1002524

These models require xpp which is available from
http://www.math.pitt.edu/~bard/xpp/xpp.html

More documentation on running XPP is available here:
