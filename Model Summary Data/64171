The model is based, whenever possible, \r\non recent single-cell and single-channel data and incorporates the \r\npossibility of changing extracellular potassium concentration [K]o. The \r\nfast sodium current, INa, is characterized by fast upstroke velocity (Vmax \r\n= 400 V/sec) and slow recovery from inactivation. The time-independent \r\npotassium current, IK1, includes a negative-slope phase and displays \r\nsignificant crossover phenomenon as [K]o is varied. The time-dependent \r\npotassium current, IK, shows only a minimal degree of crossover. A novel \r\npotassium current that activates at plateau potentials is included in \r\nthe model. The simulated action potential duplicates the experimentally \r\nobserved effects of changes in [K]o on action potential duration and rest \r\npotential.
