Membrane currents during step depolarizations were determined by \r\na method in which three electrodes were inserted near the end of a \r\nfibre in the frog's sartorius muscle. The theoretical basis and \r\nlimitations of the method are discussed.\r\n2. Measurements of the membrane capacity (CM) and resting resistance \r\n(RM) derived from the current during a step change in membrane \r\npotential are consistent with values found by other methods.\r\n3. In fibres made mechanically inactive with hypertonic solutions \r\n(Ringer solution plus 350 mM sucrose) step depolarizations produced \r\nionic currents which resembled those of nerve in showing (a) an early \r\ntransient inward current, abolished by tetrodotoxin, which reversed \r\nwhen the depolarization was carried beyond an internal potential of \r\nabout +20 mV, (b) a delayed outward current, with a linear instantaneous \r\ncurrent\u00a1Xvoltage relation, and a mean equilibrium potential with a normal \r\npotassium concentration (2\u00a1P5 mM) of -85 mV.\r\n4. The reversal potential for the early current appears to be consistent\r\nwith the sodium equilibrium potential expected in hypertonic solutions.\r\n5. The variation of the equilibrium potential for the delayed current \r\n(V\u00a1\u00acK) with external potassium concentration suggests that the channel \r\nfor delayed current has a ratio of potassium to sodium permeability of \r\n30:1; this is less than the resting membrane where the ratio appears \r\nto be 100:1. V\u00a1\u00acK corresponds well with the membrane potential at the \r\nbeginning of the negative after-potential observed under similar conditions.\r\n6. The variation of V\u00a1\u00acK with the amount of current which has passed \r\nthrough the delayed channel suggests that potassium ions accumulate in a \r\nspace of between 1/3 and 1/6 of the fibre volume. If potassium accumulates in \r\nthe transverse tubular system (T system) much greater variation in V\u00a1\u00acK \r\nwould be expected.\r\n7. The delayed current is not maintained but is inactivated like the early \r\ncurrent. The inactivation is approximately exponential with a time constant \r\nof 0\u00a1P5 to 1 sec at 20\u00a2X C. The steady-state inactivation of the potassium \r\ncurrent is similar to that for the sodium current, but its voltage \r\ndependence is less steep and the potential for half inactivation is 20 mV \r\nrate more positive.\r\n8. Reconstructions of ionic currents were made in terms of the parameters\r\n(m, n, h) of the Hodgkin\u00a1XHuxley model for the squid axon, using constants \r\nwhich showed a similar dependence on voltage.\r\n9. Propagated action potentials and conduction velocities were computed for \r\nvarious conditions on the assumption that the T system behaves as if it were \r\na series resistance and capacity in parallel with surface capacity and the \r\nchannels for sodium, potassium and leak current. There was reasonable \r\nagreement with observed values, the main difference being that the \r\ncalculated velocities and rates of rise were somewhat less than those \r\nobserved experimentally.", "attr_id": 24}, "currents": {"value": [{"object_id": 2395, "object_name": "I Sodium"}, {"object_id": 2405, "object_name": "I Potassium"}], "attr_id": 27}, "model_type": {"value": [{"object_id": 3537, "object_name": "Neuron or other electrically excitable cell"}], "attr_id": 112}, "model_concept": {"value": [{"object_id": 3649, "object_name": "Action Potentials"}], "attr_id": 113}, "modeling_application": {"value": [{"object_id": 33977, "object_name": "XPP"}], "attr_id": 114}, "model_paper": {"value": [{"object_id": 22188, "object_name": "Adrian RH, Chandler WK, Hodgkin AL (1970)"}], "attr_id": 155}, "implemented_by": {"value": [{"object_id": 57916, "object_name": "Wu, Sheng-Nan [snwu at mail.ncku.edu.tw]"}, {"object_id": 79302, "object_name": "Chen, Chien-Liang"}], "attr_id": 299}, "public_submitter_email": {"value": "snwu@mail.ncku.edu.tw", "attr_id": 309}, "other_neurons": {"value": "skeletal muscle cell", "attr_id": 301}, "other_implementer": {"value": "Chien-Liang Chen", "attr_id": 308}, "gitrepo": false}
