We present a detailed biochemical model of the CaMKII autophosphorylation and the protein signaling cascade governing the CaMKII dephosphorylation.\r\n... it is shown that the CaMKII system can qualitatively reproduce results of plasticity outcomes in response to spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) and presynaptic stimulation protocols.\r\nThis shows that the CaMKII protein network can account for both induction, through LTP/LTD-like transitions, and storage, due to its bistability, of synaptic changes.\"", "attr_id": 24}, "neurons": {"value": [{"object_id": 258, "object_name": "Hippocampus CA1 pyramidal GLU cell"}], "attr_id": 25}, "model_type": {"value": [{"object_id": 3539, "object_name": "Synapse"}], "attr_id": 112}, "model_concept": {"value": [{"object_id": 3641, "object_name": "Detailed Neuronal Models"}, {"object_id": 3643, "object_name": "Synaptic Plasticity"}, {"object_id": 3647, "object_name": "Long-term Synaptic Plasticity"}, {"object_id": 55277, "object_name": "Signaling pathways"}], "attr_id": 113}, "modeling_application": {"value": [{"object_id": 33977, "object_name": "XPP"}], "attr_id": 114}, "model_paper": {"value": [{"object_id": 114458, "object_name": "Graupner M, Brunel N (2007)"}], "attr_id": 155}, "implemented_by": {"value": [{"object_id": 114553, "object_name": "Graupner, Michael [michael.graupner at ens.fr]"}], "attr_id": 299}, "public_submitter_email": {"value": "michael.graupner@ens.fr", "attr_id": 309}, "other_implementer": {"value": "Graupner, Michael", "attr_id": 308}, "citation": {"value": "18052535", "attr_id": 391}, "gitrepo": false}
