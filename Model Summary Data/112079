ACO (0.3-30 microM) suppressed the amplitude of delayed rectifier K+ current (IK(DR)) in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 3.1 microM. The presence of ACO enhanced the rate and extent of IK(DR) inactivation, although it had no effect on the initial activation phase of IK(DR). ... A modeled cell was designed to duplicate its inhibitory effect on spontaneous pacemaking. ... Taken together, the experimental data and simulations show that ACO can block delayed rectifier K+ channels of neurons in a concentration- and state-dependent manner. Changes in action potentials induced by ACO in neurons in vivo can be explained mainly by its blocking actions on IK(DR) and INa.\"", "attr_id": 24}, "currents": {"value": [{"object_id": 248, "object_name": "I K"}, {"object_id": 2395, "object_name": "I Sodium"}, {"object_id": 2405, "object_name": "I Potassium"}, {"object_id": 88117, "object_name": "I_KHT"}], "attr_id": 27}, "model_type": {"value": [{"object_id": 3537, "object_name": "Neuron or other electrically excitable cell"}], "attr_id": 112}, "model_concept": {"value": [{"object_id": 3631, "object_name": "Ion Channel Kinetics"}, {"object_id": 3638, "object_name": "Simplified Models"}, {"object_id": 3649, "object_name": "Action Potentials"}, {"object_id": 49304, "object_name": "Methods"}], "attr_id": 113}, "modeling_application": {"value": [{"object_id": 33977, "object_name": "XPP"}], "attr_id": 114}, "model_paper": {"value": [{"object_id": 112081, "object_name": "Lin MW, Wang YJ, Liu SI, Lin AA, Lo YC, Wu SN (2008)"}], "attr_id": 155}, "implemented_by": {"value": [{"object_id": 57916, "object_name": "Wu, Sheng-Nan [snwu at mail.ncku.edu.tw]"}, {"object_id": 112082, "object_name": "Lin, Ming-Wei "}, {"object_id": 112083, "object_name": "Wan, Ya-Jean "}, {"object_id": 112084, "object_name": "Lin, An-An "}], "attr_id": 299}, "public_submitter_email": {"value": "snwu@mail.ncku.edu.tw", "attr_id": 309}, "other_neurons": {"value": "neuroblastoma cells", "attr_id": 301}, "other_implementer": {"value": "Ming-Wei Lin, Ya-Jean Wan, An-An Lin and Sheng-Nan Wu", "attr_id": 308}, "citation": {"value": "Lin MW, Wang YJ, Liu SI, Lin AA, Lo YC, Wu SN.
