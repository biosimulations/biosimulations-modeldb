Neurons in higher brain regions have stronger ADs and are more easily injured than neurons in lower brain region. The mechanism leading to such differences is not clear. We use a computational model based on a Hodgkin-Huxley framework which includes neural spiking dynamics, processes of ion accumulation, and homeostatic mechanisms like vascular coupling and Na/K-exchange pumps. We show that a large extracellular space (ECS) explains the recovery failure in high brain regions. A phase-space analysis shows that with a large ECS recovery from AD through potassium regulation is impossible. The code 'time_series.ode' can be used to simulate AD for a large and a small ECS and show the different behaviors. The code \u2018continuations.ode\u2019 can be used to show the fixed point structure. Depending on our choice of large or small ECS the fixed point curve implies the presence/absence of a recovery threshold that defines the potassium clearance demand.", "attr_id": 24}, "currents": {"value": [{"object_id": 240, "object_name": "I Chloride"}, {"object_id": 242, "object_name": "I Na,t"}, {"object_id": 248, "object_name": "I K"}, {"object_id": 249, "object_name": "I K,leak"}, {"object_id": 251, "object_name": "I h"}, {"object_id": 2395, "object_name": "I Sodium"}, {"object_id": 2405, "object_name": "I Potassium"}, {"object_id": 116966, "object_name": "I_K,Na"}, {"object_id": 120693, "object_name": "Na/K pump"}, {"object_id": 139267, "object_name": "I Cl, leak"}, {"object_id": 139268, "object_name": "I Na, leak"}], "attr_id": 27}, "model_type": {"value": [{"object_id": 3537, "object_name": "Neuron or other electrically excitable cell"}], "attr_id": 112}, "model_concept": {"value": [{"object_id": 3649, "object_name": "Action Potentials"}, {"object_id": 52404, "object_name": "Pathophysiology"}, {"object_id": 120695, "object_name": "Sodium pump"}, {"object_id": 121254, "object_name": "Depolarization block"}, {"object_id": 144409, "object_name": "Homeostasis"}, {"object_id": 151948, "object_name": "Potassium buffering"}], "attr_id": 113}, "modeling_application": {"value": [{"object_id": 33977, "object_name": "XPP"}], "attr_id": 114}, "model_paper": {"value": [{"object_id": 188279, "object_name": "H\u00fcbel N, Andrew RD, Ullah G (2016)"}], "attr_id": 155}, "public_submitter_email": {"value": "niklas.huebel@gmail.com", "attr_id": 309}, "gitrepo": false, "neurons": {"value": [{"object_id": 156124, "object_name": "Abstract single compartment conductance based cell"}], "attr_id": 414}}
