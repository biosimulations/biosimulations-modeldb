Though such effects have been demonstrated in single cells, there are no studies that examine how such mechanisms may lead to the effects of dopamine at a neural network level. In this study, we investigated the effects of dopamine on synchronization in two simulated neural networks; one biophysical model composed of Wang-Buzsaki neurons and a reduced model with theta neurons. In both models, we show that parametrically varying the levels of dopamine, modeled through the changes in the excitability of interneurons, reveals an inverted-U shaped relationship, with low gamma band power at both low and high dopamine levels and optimal synchronization at intermediate levels. Moreover, such a relationship holds when the external input is both tonic and periodic at gamma band range. Together, our results indicate that dopamine can modulate cortical gamma band synchrony in an inverted-U fashion and that the physiologic effects of dopamine on single fast-spiking interneurons can give rise to such non-monotonic effects at the network level.", "attr_id": 24}, "model_type": {"value": [{"object_id": 3536, "object_name": "Realistic Network"}], "attr_id": 112}, "model_concept": {"value": [{"object_id": 3635, "object_name": "Synchronization"}], "attr_id": 113}, "modeling_application": {"value": [{"object_id": 33977, "object_name": "XPP"}], "attr_id": 114}, "model_paper": {"value": [{"object_id": 146735, "object_name": "K\u00f6mek K, Bard Ermentrout G, Walker CP, Cho RY (2012)"}], "attr_id": 155}, "implemented_by": {"value": [{"object_id": 76884, "object_name": "Ermentrout, Bard [bard_at_pitt.edu]"}, {"object_id": 146804, "object_name": "Komek, Kubra [kkomek at andrew.cmu.edu]"}], "attr_id": 299}, "public_submitter_email": {"value": "kkomek@andrew.cmu.edu", "attr_id": 309}, "other_neurons": {"value": "Wang-Buzsaki neuron & theta neuron", "attr_id": 301}, "neurotransmitters": {"value": [{"object_id": 224, "object_name": "Dopamine"}], "attr_id": 28}, "other_implementer": {"value": "Komek, Kubra <kkomek@andrew.cmu.edu>", "attr_id": 308}, "citation": {"value": "22805060", "attr_id": 391}, "gitrepo": false, "neurons": {"value": [{"object_id": 146805, "object_name": "Abstract Wang-Buzsaki neuron"}, {"object_id": 146806, "object_name": "Abstract theta neuron"}], "attr_id": 414}}
