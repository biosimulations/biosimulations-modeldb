The closed-loop system exhibits bistability of bursting and tonic spiking. Bursting corresponds to coexistence of eupnea-like breathing, with normal minute ventilation and blood oxygen level. Tonic spiking corresponds to a tachypnea-like state, with pathologically reduced minute ventilation and critically low blood oxygen. In our paper, we use the closed-loop system to demonstrate robustness to changes in metabolic demand, spontaneous autoresuscitation in response to hypoxia, and the distinct mechanisms that underlie rhythmogenesis in the intact control circuit vs. the isolated, open-loop CPG.", "attr_id": 24}, "currents": {"value": [{"object_id": 241, "object_name": "I Na,p"}, {"object_id": 242, "object_name": "I Na,t"}, {"object_id": 248, "object_name": "I K"}], "attr_id": 27}, "model_type": {"value": [{"object_id": 3537, "object_name": "Neuron or other electrically excitable cell"}], "attr_id": 112}, "model_concept": {"value": [{"object_id": 227131, "object_name": "Pacemaking mechanism"}, {"object_id": 232102, "object_name": "Respiratory control"}], "attr_id": 113}, "modeling_application": {"value": [{"object_id": 36835, "object_name": "MATLAB"}, {"object_id": 33977, "object_name": "XPP"}], "attr_id": 114}, "model_paper": {"value": [{"object_id": 232100, "object_name": "Diekman CO, Thomas PJ, Wilson CG (2017)"}], "attr_id": 155}, "region": {"value": [{"object_id": 183076, "object_name": "Brainstem"}], "attr_id": 471}, "implemented_by": {"value": [{"object_id": 232101, "object_name": "Diekman, Casey O.
