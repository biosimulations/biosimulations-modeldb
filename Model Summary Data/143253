We then used modified Pinsky-Rinzel simulation modeling to evaluate its effects on spontaneous action potentials (APs). \r\n\r\nFinally, we investigated its effects on pilocarpine-induced seizures in rats. \r\n\r\nResults: EUG depressed the transient and late components of INa in the neurons. \r\n\r\nIt not only increased the degree of INa inactivation, but specifically suppressed the non-inactivating INa (INa(NI)). \r\n\r\n... In addition, EUG diminished L-type Ca2+ current and delayed rectifier K+ current only at higher concentrations. EUG`s effects on APs frequency reduction was verified by the simulation modeling. \r\n\r\nIn pilocarpine-induced seizures, the EUG-treated rats showed no shorter seizure latency but a lower seizure severity and mortality than the control rats. \r\n\r\n...\r\nConclusion: The synergistic blocking effects of INa and INa(NI) contributes to the main mechanism through which EUG affects the firing of neuronal APs and modulate neuronal hyperexcitability such as pilocarpine-induced temporal lobe seizures.\"", "attr_id": 24}, "currents": {"value": [{"object_id": 241, "object_name": "I Na,p"}, {"object_id": 242, "object_name": "I Na,t"}, {"object_id": 2395, "object_name": "I Sodium"}, {"object_id": 87769, "object_name": "ATP-senstive potassium current"}], "attr_id": 27}, "model_type": {"value": [{"object_id": 3540, "object_name": "Channel/Receptor"}], "attr_id": 112}, "model_concept": {"value": [{"object_id": 3631, "object_name": "Ion Channel Kinetics"}, {"object_id": 3638, "object_name": "Simplified Models"}, {"object_id": 3649, "object_name": "Action Potentials"}], "attr_id": 113}, "modeling_application": {"value": [{"object_id": 33977, "object_name": "XPP"}], "attr_id": 114}, "model_paper": {"value": [{"object_id": 143255, "object_name": "Huang CW, Chow JC, Tsai JJ, Wu SN (2012)"}], "attr_id": 155}, "implemented_by": {"value": [{"object_id": 57916, "object_name": "Wu, Sheng-Nan [snwu at mail.ncku.edu.tw]"}, {"object_id": 84610, "object_name": "Huang, Chin-Wei"}], "attr_id": 299}, "public_submitter_email": {"value": "snwu@mail.ncku.edu.tw", "attr_id": 309}, "citation": {"value": "Huang CW, Chow JC, Tsai JJ, Wu SN.
