The bursting arises as the fast-spiking behavior of the neuron is modulated\r\nby the slow oscillatory behavior in the ion concentration variables and vice versa. By\r\nseparating these time scales and studying the bifurcation structure of the neuron, we catalog\r\nseveral qualitatively different bursting profiles that are strikingly similar to those seen in\r\nexperimental preparations. Our work suggests that ion concentration dynamics may play an\r\nimportant role in modulating neuronal excitability in real biological systems.\"", "attr_id": 24}, "model_type": {"value": [{"object_id": 3537, "object_name": "Neuron or other electrically excitable cell"}], "attr_id": 112}, "model_concept": {"value": [{"object_id": 3630, "object_name": "Bursting"}, {"object_id": 3634, "object_name": "Oscillations"}, {"object_id": 3638, "object_name": "Simplified Models"}, {"object_id": 121254, "object_name": "Depolarization block"}], "attr_id": 113}, "modeling_application": {"value": [{"object_id": 3529, "object_name": "C or C++ program"}, {"object_id": 33977, "object_name": "XPP"}], "attr_id": 114}, "model_paper": {"value": [{"object_id": 140546, "object_name": "Barreto E, Cressman JR (2011)"}], "attr_id": 155}, "region": {"value": [{"object_id": 115960, "object_name": "Generic"}], "attr_id": 471}, "implemented_by": {"value": [{"object_id": 136797, "object_name": "Barreto, Ernest "}], "attr_id": 299}, "public_submitter_email": {"value": "ebarreto@gmu.edu", "attr_id": 309}, "other_neurons": {"value": "Hodgkin-Huxley + ion concentration dynamics", "attr_id": 301}, "gitrepo": false, "neurons": {"value": [{"object_id": 114737, "object_name": "Hodgkin-Huxley neuron"}], "attr_id": 414}}
