Phase plane methods and numerical solutions are then used to investigate\r\npopulation responses to various types of stimuli. The results obtained show simple\r\nand multiple hysteresis phenomena and limit cycle activity. The latter is particularly\r\ninteresting since the frequency of the limit cycle oscillation is found to be a monotonic\r\nfunction of stimulus intensity. Finally, it is proved that the existence of limit cycle\r\ndynamics in response to one class of stimuli implies the existence of multiple stable\r\nstates and hysteresis in response to a different class of stimuli. The relation between\r\nthese findings and a number of experiments is discussed.", "attr_id": 24}, "model_type": {"value": [{"object_id": 3536, "object_name": "Realistic Network"}], "attr_id": 112}, "model_concept": {"value": [{"object_id": 3543, "object_name": "Activity Patterns"}], "attr_id": 113}, "modeling_application": {"value": [{"object_id": 1882, "object_name": "NEURON"}, {"object_id": 33977, "object_name": "XPP"}], "attr_id": 114}, "model_paper": {"value": [{"object_id": 5830, "object_name": "Wilson HR, Cowan JD (1972)"}], "attr_id": 155}, "region": {"value": [{"object_id": 115960, "object_name": "Generic"}], "attr_id": 471}, "implemented_by": {"value": [{"object_id": 33738, "object_name": "Lytton, William [bill.lytton at downstate.edu]"}, {"object_id": 76884, "object_name": "Ermentrout, Bard [bard_at_pitt.edu]"}], "attr_id": 299}, "simPFid": {"value": 242, "attr_id": 488}, "has_modelview": {"value": true, "attr_id": 502}, "hide_autolaunch_button": {"value": false, "attr_id": 582}, "runprotocols": {"value": [{"object_id": 181403, "object_name": "76879_6"}, {"object_id": 181405, "object_name": "76879_4"}, {"object_id": 181408, "object_name": "76879_1"}, {"object_id": 181897, "object_name": "76879_5"}, {"object_id": 181903, "object_name": "76879_3"}, {"object_id": 181905, "object_name": "76879_2"}], "attr_id": 613}, "gitrepo": false}
