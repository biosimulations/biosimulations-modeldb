All models are in the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism, adapted from previously published models for each cell type.  The connected circuit produces irregular activity under control conditions, but increasing FSI-to-MSN connectivity as observed experimentally under dopamine depletion yields exaggerated beta oscillations and synchrony.
