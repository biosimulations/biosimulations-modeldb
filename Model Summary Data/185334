We derive a one-dimensional map whose fixed points correspond to periodic anti-phase bursting solutions. The model here solves a novel double boundary value problem that can be used to obtain the graph of this map.\r\n\r\nRead More: http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0218127415400040", "attr_id": 24}, "model_type": {"value": [{"object_id": 3537, "object_name": "Neuron or other electrically excitable cell"}], "attr_id": 112}, "model_concept": {"value": [{"object_id": 3634, "object_name": "Oscillations"}], "attr_id": 113}, "modeling_application": {"value": [{"object_id": 33977, "object_name": "XPP"}], "attr_id": 114}, "model_paper": {"value": [{"object_id": 185337, "object_name": "Bose A, Rubin JE (2015)"}], "attr_id": 155}, "implemented_by": {"value": [{"object_id": 125612, "object_name": "Rubin, Jonathan E [jonrubin at pitt.edu]"}], "attr_id": 299}, "public_submitter_email": {"value": "jonrubin@pitt.edu", "attr_id": 309}, "other_neurons": {"value": "half-center oscillator", "attr_id": 301}, "other_concept": {"value": "Mutual inhibition", "attr_id": 306}, "citation": {"value": "Bose, A., & Rubin, J.
