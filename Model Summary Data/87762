However, their underlying \r\nmechanism remains elusive. ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) channels are \r\nfound in many excitable cells, including cardiac myocytes, \r\npancreatic beta cells, and neurons. These channels provide a link \r\nbetween the electrical activity of cell membranes and cellular \r\nmetabolism. We investigated the effects of higher extracellular \r\nglucose on hippocampal K(ATP) channel activities and neuronal \r\nexcitability. The cell-attached patch-clamp configuration on \r\ncultured hippocampal cells and a novel multielectrode recording \r\nsystem on hippocampal slices were employed. In addition, a \r\nsimulation modeling hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons (Pinsky-Rinzel \r\nmodel) was analyzed to investigate the role of K(ATP) channels in \r\nthe firing of simulated action potentials. ...\"", "attr_id": 24}, "neurons": {"value": [{"object_id": 259, "object_name": "Hippocampus CA3 pyramidal GLU cell"}], "attr_id": 25}, "currents": {"value": [{"object_id": 248, "object_name": "I K"}, {"object_id": 2405, "object_name": "I Potassium"}, {"object_id": 87769, "object_name": "ATP-senstive potassium current"}], "attr_id": 27}, "model_type": {"value": [{"object_id": 3537, "object_name": "Neuron or other electrically excitable cell"}], "attr_id": 112}, "model_concept": {"value": [{"object_id": 3543, "object_name": "Activity Patterns"}, {"object_id": 3630, "object_name": "Bursting"}, {"object_id": 3634, "object_name": "Oscillations"}, {"object_id": 3649, "object_name": "Action Potentials"}, {"object_id": 52405, "object_name": "Epilepsy"}], "attr_id": 113}, "modeling_application": {"value": [{"object_id": 33977, "object_name": "XPP"}], "attr_id": 114}, "model_paper": {"value": [{"object_id": 87763, "object_name": "Huang CW, Huang CC, Cheng JT, Tsai JJ, Wu SN (2007)"}], "attr_id": 155}, "implemented_by": {"value": [{"object_id": 57916, "object_name": "Wu, Sheng-Nan [snwu at mail.ncku.edu.tw]"}, {"object_id": 84610, "object_name": "Huang, Chin-Wei"}], "attr_id": 299}, "public_submitter_email": {"value": "snwu@mail.ncku.edu.tw", "attr_id": 309}, "other_currents": {"value": "ATP-senstive potassiun current", "attr_id": 303}, "other_implementer": {"value": "Dr. Chin-Wei Huang", "attr_id": 308}, "citation": {"value": "17410601", "attr_id": 391}, "gitrepo": false}
