We show how the major response types are generated in the model as a result of the underlying bifurcation structure. By varying key channel parameters, mimicking blockers used by experimentalists, we manipulate this underlying bifurcation structure and predict how the distributions of responses can change. We find that store-operated calcium channels, plasma membrane bound channels with little activity during calcium transients, have a surprisingly strong effect, underscoring the importance of considering these channels in both experiments and mathematical settings. ...\"", "attr_id": 24}, "currents": {"value": [{"object_id": 146507, "object_name": "Ca pump"}, {"object_id": 88211, "object_name": "I_SERCA"}, {"object_id": 2396, "object_name": "I Calcium"}], "attr_id": 27}, "receptors": {"value": [{"object_id": 153715, "object_name": "IP3"}], "attr_id": 26}, "model_type": {"value": [{"object_id": 120799, "object_name": "Glia"}], "attr_id": 112}, "model_concept": {"value": [{"object_id": 98012, "object_name": "Calcium dynamics"}, {"object_id": 3634, "object_name": "Oscillations"}, {"object_id": 143724, "object_name": "Bifurcation"}], "attr_id": 113}, "modeling_application": {"value": [{"object_id": 36835, "object_name": "MATLAB"}, {"object_id": 33977, "object_name": "XPP"}], "attr_id": 114}, "model_paper": {"value": [{"object_id": 226598, "object_name": "Handy G, Taheri M, White JA, Borisyuk A (2017)"}], "attr_id": 155}, "implemented_by": {"value": [{"object_id": 226599, "object_name": "Handy, Gregory [handy at math.utah.edu]"}, {"object_id": 226600, "object_name": "Taheri, Marsa "}], "attr_id": 299}, "other_currents": {"value": "I_SOC", "attr_id": 303}, "other_type": {"value": "Astrocytes", "attr_id": 305}, "other_simulator": {"value": "XPP", "attr_id": 307}, "other_implementer": {"value": "Gregory Handy, Marsa Taheri", "attr_id": 308}, "has_modelview": {"value": false, "attr_id": 502}, "hide_autolaunch_button": {"value": false, "attr_id": 582}, "gitrepo": false}
