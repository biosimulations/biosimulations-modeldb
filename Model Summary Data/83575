Previous modeling studies examined the ways in which membrane conductances contribute to the electrical activity of R15 and the ways in which extrinsic modulatory inputs alter the membrane conductances by biochemical cascades and influence the electrical activity. The goals of the present study were to examine the ways in which electrical activity influences the biochemical cascades and what dynamical properties emerge from the ongoing interactions between electrical activity and these cascades.\" See paper for more and details.", "attr_id": 24}, "currents": {"value": [{"object_id": 241, "object_name": "I Na,p"}, {"object_id": 242, "object_name": "I Na,t"}, {"object_id": 244, "object_name": "I N"}, {"object_id": 247, "object_name": "I A"}, {"object_id": 248, "object_name": "I K"}, {"object_id": 251, "object_name": "I h"}, {"object_id": 253, "object_name": "I K,Ca"}, {"object_id": 2395, "object_name": "I Sodium"}, {"object_id": 2396, "object_name": "I Calcium"}, {"object_id": 2405, "object_name": "I Potassium"}, {"object_id": 3277, "object_name": "I A, slow"}], "attr_id": 27}, "receptors": {"value": [{"object_id": 196, "object_name": "D1"}, {"object_id": 197, "object_name": "D2"}, {"object_id": 198, "object_name": "5-HT1"}, {"object_id": 199, "object_name": "5-HT2"}, {"object_id": 200, "object_name": "5-HT4"}, {"object_id": 208, "object_name": "5-HT3"}, {"object_id": 223, "object_name": "Dopaminergic Receptor"}], "attr_id": 26}, "model_type": {"value": [{"object_id": 3537, "object_name": "Neuron or other electrically excitable cell"}], "attr_id": 112}, "model_concept": {"value": [{"object_id": 3541, "object_name": "Action Potential Initiation"}, {"object_id": 3543, "object_name": "Activity Patterns"}, {"object_id": 3630, "object_name": "Bursting"}, {"object_id": 3631, "object_name": "Ion Channel Kinetics"}, {"object_id": 3634, "object_name": "Oscillations"}, {"object_id": 3641, "object_name": "Detailed Neuronal Models"}, {"object_id": 3649, "object_name": "Action Potentials"}, {"object_id": 47316, "object_name": "Invertebrate"}], "attr_id": 113}, "modeling_application": {"value": [{"object_id": 33977, "object_name": "XPP"}], "attr_id": 114}, "model_paper": {"value": [{"object_id": 83576, "object_name": "Yu X, Byrne JH, Baxter DA (2004)"}], "attr_id": 155}, "gene": {"value": [{"object_id": 122828, "object_name": "D1 DRD1A"}, {"object_id": 122829, "object_name": "D2 DRD2"}], "attr_id": 476}, "public_submitter_email": {"value": "douglas.baxter@uth.tmc.edu", "attr_id": 309}, "other_neurons": {"value": "R15", "attr_id": 301}, "neurotransmitters": {"value": [{"object_id": 224, "object_name": "Dopamine"}, {"object_id": 239, "object_name": "Serotonin"}], "attr_id": 28}, "other_concept": {"value": "second messenger", "attr_id": 306}, "citation": {"value": "PMID: 14702331", "attr_id": 391}, "gitrepo": false, "neurons": {"value": [{"object_id": 52420, "object_name": "Aplysia R15 bursting neuron"}], "attr_id": 414}}
