Speci&#64257;cally, we assume that an integrator converts\r\nexcitatory input into a graded mnemonic activity that provides an\r\ninhibitory signal (integral feedback control) to upstream afferent\r\nneurons. We demonstrate this scenario in a neuronal-network\r\nmodel for a temporal discrimination task...
