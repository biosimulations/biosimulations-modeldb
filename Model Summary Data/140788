In this work, we extend previous modeling studies to systematically investigate the mechanisms underlying the generation of plateau potentials in motoneurons, including the influences of specific ionic currents, the morphological characteristics of the soma and dendrite, and the interactions between persistent inward currents and synaptic input.\r\n...\"", "attr_id": 24}, "neurons": {"value": [{"object_id": 276, "object_name": "Spinal cord lumbar motor neuron alpha ACh cell"}], "attr_id": 25}, "currents": {"value": [{"object_id": 241, "object_name": "I Na,p"}, {"object_id": 253, "object_name": "I K,Ca"}, {"object_id": 255, "object_name": "I CAN"}, {"object_id": 2395, "object_name": "I Sodium"}, {"object_id": 2405, "object_name": "I Potassium"}, {"object_id": 140826, "object_name": "I Ca,p"}], "attr_id": 27}, "model_type": {"value": [{"object_id": 3537, "object_name": "Neuron or other electrically excitable cell"}], "attr_id": 112}, "model_concept": {"value": [{"object_id": 3638, "object_name": "Simplified Models"}, {"object_id": 3639, "object_name": "Active Dendrites"}, {"object_id": 41934, "object_name": "Intrinsic plasticity"}, {"object_id": 64174, "object_name": "Synaptic Integration"}], "attr_id": 113}, "modeling_application": {"value": [{"object_id": 33977, "object_name": "XPP"}, {"object_id": 36835, "object_name": "MATLAB"}], "attr_id": 114}, "model_paper": {"value": [{"object_id": 140794, "object_name": "Kurian M, Crook SM, Jung R (2011)"}], "attr_id": 155}, "region": {"value": [{"object_id": 115954, "object_name": "Spinal motoneuron"}], "attr_id": 471}, "implemented_by": {"value": [{"object_id": 140824, "object_name": "Kurian, Mini "}, {"object_id": 140825, "object_name": "Crook, Sharon "}], "attr_id": 299}, "public_submitter_email": {"value": "minikurian@gmail.com", "attr_id": 309}, "other_currents": {"value": "INaP, ICaP", "attr_id": 303}, "other_implementer": {"value": "Kurian, Mini; Crook, Sharon", "attr_id": 308}, "gitrepo": false}
