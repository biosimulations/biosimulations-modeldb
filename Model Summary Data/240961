With the aid of patch-clamp technology and simulation modeling,\r\nthe effects of (Rotenone) Rot on membrane ion currents present in\r\nmHippoE-14 cells were investigated. Results: Addition of Rot produced\r\nan inhibitory action on the peak amplitude of INa ...; however,\r\nneither activation nor inactivation kinetics of INa was changed during\r\ncell exposure to this compound. Addition of Rot produced little or no\r\nmodifications in the steady-state inactivation curve of INa. Rot\r\nincreased the amplitude of Ca2+-activated Cl- current in response to\r\nmembrane depolarization ... . Moreover, when these cells were exposed\r\nto 10 \u00b5M Rot, a specific population of ATP-sensitive K+ channels\r\n... was measured, despite its inability to alter single-channel\r\nconductance. Under current clamp condition, the frequency of miniature\r\nend-plate potentials in mHippoE-14 cells was significantly raised in\r\nthe presence of Rot (10 \u00b5M) with no changes in their amplitude and\r\ntime course of rise and decay. In simulated model of hippocampal\r\nneurons incorporated with chemical autaptic connection, increased\r\nautaptic strength to mimic the action of Rot was noted to change the\r\nbursting pattern with emergence of subthreshold\r\npotentials. Conclusions: The Rot effects presented herein might exert\r\na significant action on functional activities of hippocampal neurons\r\noccurring in vivo. \"", "attr_id": 24}, "neurons": {"value": [{"object_id": 259, "object_name": "Hippocampus CA3 pyramidal GLU cell"}], "attr_id": 25}, "currents": {"value": [{"object_id": 247, "object_name": "I A"}, {"object_id": 2396, "object_name": "I Calcium"}, {"object_id": 253, "object_name": "I K,Ca"}, {"object_id": 242, "object_name": "I Na,t"}, {"object_id": 143445, "object_name": "I_KD"}], "attr_id": 27}, "model_type": {"value": [{"object_id": 3537, "object_name": "Neuron or other electrically excitable cell"}], "attr_id": 112}, "model_concept": {"value": [{"object_id": 3649, "object_name": "Action Potentials"}, {"object_id": 3630, "object_name": "Bursting"}, {"object_id": 183995, "object_name": "Ephaptic coupling"}], "attr_id": 113}, "modeling_application": {"value": [{"object_id": 33977, "object_name": "XPP"}], "attr_id": 114}, "model_paper": {"value": [{"object_id": 240965, "object_name": "Huang CW, Lin KM, Hung TY, Chuang YC, Wu SN (2018)"}], "attr_id": 155}, "region": {"value": [{"object_id": 115946, "object_name": "Hippocampus"}], "attr_id": 471}, "implemented_by": {"value": [{"object_id": 57916, "object_name": "Wu, Sheng-Nan [snwu at mail.ncku.edu.tw]"}], "attr_id": 299}, "public_submitter_email": {"value": "snwu@mail.ncku.edu.tw", "attr_id": 309}, "citation": {"value": "Huange et al.
