The most notable mechanisms include ClC-2 (a rectifying chloride-leak channel) and KCC2 (potassium chloride co-transporter 2).  A significant feature of the model is that it tracks intracellular chloride concentration.  Moreover, the GABA-A receptor is modeled as passing both chloride and bicarbonate ions, which is important for proper calculation of the GABA reversal potential. Ornstein-Unlenbeck processes to simulate synaptic inhibition and excitation are also included.\"\r\n", "attr_id": 24}, "currents": {"value": [{"object_id": 139267, "object_name": "I Cl, leak"}], "attr_id": 27}, "model_type": {"value": [{"object_id": 3537, "object_name": "Neuron or other electrically excitable cell"}], "attr_id": 112}, "model_concept": {"value": [{"object_id": 143004, "object_name": "Chloride regulation"}], "attr_id": 113}, "modeling_application": {"value": [{"object_id": 33977, "object_name": "XPP"}], "attr_id": 114}, "model_paper": {"value": [{"object_id": 142626, "object_name": "Ratt\u00e9 S, Prescott SA (2011)"}], "attr_id": 155}, "gene": {"value": [{"object_id": 143068, "object_name": "CLC-2 CLCN2"}], "attr_id": 476}, "implemented_by": {"value": [{"object_id": 53570, "object_name": "Prescott, Steven [steve.prescott at sickkids.ca]]"}], "attr_id": 299}, "gitrepo": false}
