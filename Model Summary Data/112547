We propose here a mathematical model of how spontaneous Ca2+ \r\noscillations arise in astrocytes.

By computationally mimicking experimental constraints we have found that this model provides \r\nresults that are qualitatively similar to experiment.\"", "attr_id": 24}, "receptors": {"value": [{"object_id": 153715, "object_name": "IP3"}], "attr_id": 26}, "model_type": {"value": [{"object_id": 120694, "object_name": "Electrogenic pump"}, {"object_id": 120799, "object_name": "Glia"}], "attr_id": 112}, "model_concept": {"value": [{"object_id": 3634, "object_name": "Oscillations"}, {"object_id": 3638, "object_name": "Simplified Models"}, {"object_id": 55277, "object_name": "Signaling pathways"}, {"object_id": 98012, "object_name": "Calcium dynamics"}, {"object_id": 150554, "object_name": "Calcium waves"}], "attr_id": 113}, "modeling_application": {"value": [{"object_id": 33977, "object_name": "XPP"}], "attr_id": 114}, "model_paper": {"value": [{"object_id": 112550, "object_name": "Lavrentovich M, Hemkin S (2008)"}], "attr_id": 155}, "implemented_by": {"value": [{"object_id": 57916, "object_name": "Wu, Sheng-Nan [snwu at mail.ncku.edu.tw]"}], "attr_id": 299}, "public_submitter_email": {"value": "snwu@mail.ncku.edu.tw", "attr_id": 309}, "neurotransmitters": {"value": [{"object_id": 236, "object_name": "Ions"}], "attr_id": 28}, "citation": {"value": "Laventovich and Hemkin.
