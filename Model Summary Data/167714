The dynamics is therefore limited to a time scale of milliseconds, which is determined by the membrane capacitance multiplied by the resistance of the ion channels, and by the gating time constants. This model includes slow dynamics in an extended HH framework that simulates time-dependent ion concentrations, pumps, and buffers. Fluxes across the neuronal membrane change intra- and extracellular ion concentrations, whereby the latter can also change through contact to reservoirs in the surroundings. The dynamics on three distinct slow times scales is determined by the cell volume-to-surface-area ratio and the membrane permeability (seconds), the buffer time constants (tens of seconds), and the slower backward buffering (minutes to hours). The modulatory dynamics and the newly emerging excitable dynamics corresponds to pathological conditions observed in epileptiform burst activity, and spreading depression in migraine aura and stroke, respectively.", "attr_id": 24}, "currents": {"value": [{"object_id": 242, "object_name": "I Na,t"}, {"object_id": 248, "object_name": "I K"}, {"object_id": 249, "object_name": "I K,leak"}, {"object_id": 120693, "object_name": "Na/K pump"}, {"object_id": 139267, "object_name": "I Cl, leak"}, {"object_id": 139268, "object_name": "I Na, leak"}], "attr_id": 27}, "model_type": {"value": [{"object_id": 3537, "object_name": "Neuron or other electrically excitable cell"}], "attr_id": 112}, "model_concept": {"value": [{"object_id": 144409, "object_name": "Homeostasis"}, {"object_id": 167716, "object_name": "Spreading depression"}], "attr_id": 113}, "modeling_application": {"value": [{"object_id": 33977, "object_name": "XPP"}], "attr_id": 114}, "model_paper": {"value": [{"object_id": 167721, "object_name": "H\u00fcbel N, Dahlem MA (2014)"}], "attr_id": 155}, "public_submitter_email": {"value": "markus.dahlem@gmail.com", "attr_id": 309}, "other_concept": {"value": "Spreading depression", "attr_id": 306}, "has_modelview": {"value": false, "attr_id": 502}, "hide_autolaunch_button": {"value": false, "attr_id": 582}, "gitrepo": false}
