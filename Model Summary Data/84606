However, little is known regarding the mechanism of ZNS actions on ion currents in neurons.  We thus investigated its effect on ion currents in differentiated hippocampal 19-7 cells.  The ZNS (30 uM) reversibly increased the amplitude of K+ outward currents and paxilline (1 uM) was effective in suppressing ZNS-induced increase of K+ outward currents.  In inside-out configuration, ZNS (30 uM) applied to the intracellular face of the membrane did not alter single-channel conductance; however, it did enhance the activity of large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (BKCa) channels primarily by decreasing mean closed time.  The EC50 value for ZNS-stimulated BKCa channels was 34 uM.  This drug caused a left shift in the activation curve of BKCa channels with no change in the gating charge of these channels.  ZNS at a concentration greater than 100 uM also reduced the amplitude of A-type K+ current in these cells.  A simulation modeling based on hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons (Pinsky-Rinzel model) was also analyzed to investigate the inhibitory effect of ZNS on the firing of simulated action potentials.  Taken together, this study suggests that in hippocampal neurons, during the exposure to ZNS, the ZNS-mediated effects on BKCa channels and IA could be one of the ionic mechanisms through which it affects neuronal excitability.", "attr_id": 24}, "neurons": {"value": [{"object_id": 259, "object_name": "Hippocampus CA3 pyramidal GLU cell"}], "attr_id": 25}, "currents": {"value": [{"object_id": 253, "object_name": "I K,Ca"}, {"object_id": 2395, "object_name": "I Sodium"}], "attr_id": 27}, "model_type": {"value": [{"object_id": 3537, "object_name": "Neuron or other electrically excitable cell"}], "attr_id": 112}, "model_concept": {"value": [{"object_id": 3631, "object_name": "Ion Channel Kinetics"}, {"object_id": 3645, "object_name": "Axonal Action Potentials"}, {"object_id": 52405, "object_name": "Epilepsy"}], "attr_id": 113}, "modeling_application": {"value": [{"object_id": 33977, "object_name": "XPP"}], "attr_id": 114}, "model_paper": {"value": [{"object_id": 84609, "object_name": "Huang CW, Huang CC, Wu SN (2007)"}], "attr_id": 155}, "implemented_by": {"value": [{"object_id": 57916, "object_name": "Wu, Sheng-Nan [snwu at mail.ncku.edu.tw]"}, {"object_id": 84610, "object_name": "Huang, Chin-Wei"}], "attr_id": 299}, "public_submitter_email": {"value": "snwu@mail.ncku.edu.tw", "attr_id": 309}, "other_simulator": {"value": "Dr. Chin-Wei Huang", "attr_id": 307}, "citation": {"value": "Zonisamide-induced inhibition on the firing of action potentials in hippocampal neuron", "attr_id": 391}, "gitrepo": false}
