Low firing rates are supported in extended regimes by adaptation currents and the minimal firing rate decreases with the persistent sodium conductance gNaP and increases with M-potassium  \r\nand h-cation conductances. Suprathreshold resonance results from the locking properties of vMN firing to stimuli and from reduction of firing rates at low frequencies by slow M and afterhyperpolarization potassium conductances. h conductance only slightly affects the suprathreshold resonance. When a vMN is subjected to a small periodic CPG input, serotonergically induced gNaP elevation may transfer the system from quiescence to a firing state that is highly\r\nlocked to the CPG input.\r\n", "attr_id": 24}, "currents": {"value": [{"object_id": 241, "object_name": "I Na,p"}, {"object_id": 242, "object_name": "I Na,t"}, {"object_id": 248, "object_name": "I K"}, {"object_id": 250, "object_name": "I M"}, {"object_id": 251, "object_name": "I h"}, {"object_id": 127083, "object_name": "I_AHP"}], "attr_id": 27}, "model_type": {"value": [{"object_id": 3537, "object_name": "Neuron or other electrically excitable cell"}], "attr_id": 112}, "model_concept": {"value": [{"object_id": 127084, "object_name": "Locking, mixed mode"}], "attr_id": 113}, "modeling_application": {"value": [{"object_id": 33977, "object_name": "XPP"}], "attr_id": 114}, "model_paper": {"value": [{"object_id": 127026, "object_name": "Harish O, Golomb D (2010)"}], "attr_id": 155}, "implemented_by": {"value": [{"object_id": 57906, "object_name": "Golomb, David [golomb at bgu.ac.il]"}, {"object_id": 127023, "object_name": "Harish, Omri [omriharish at gmail.com]"}], "attr_id": 299}, "public_submitter_email": {"value": "golomb@bgu.ac.il", "attr_id": 309}, "other_neurons": {"value": "Vibrissa motoneuron", "attr_id": 301}, "neurotransmitters": {"value": [{"object_id": 239, "object_name": "Serotonin"}], "attr_id": 28}, "other_currents": {"value": "I_Na, I_NaP, I_Kdr, I_AHP, I_M, I_h", "attr_id": 303}, "other_concept": {"value": "Locking, mixed-mode", "attr_id": 306}, "other_implementer": {"value": "Harish, Omri <omriharish@gmail.com>", "attr_id": 308}, "citation": {"value": "O.
