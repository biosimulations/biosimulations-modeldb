Under stimulation of an external periodic voltage, the \r\nISIs (interspike intervals) of a HH model are investigated in this work, \r\nwhile the frequency of the voltage is taken as the controlling parameter. \r\nAs well-known, the science of acupuncture and moxibustion is an important \r\ncomponent of Traditional Chinese Medicine with a long history. Although there \r\nare a number of different acupuncture manipulations, the method for \r\ndistinguishing them is rarely investigated.
