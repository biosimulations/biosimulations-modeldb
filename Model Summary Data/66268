In this neuron model,\r\nreduced [Ca2+]o is simulated by negatively shifting the activation curve of the persistent Na+ current\r\n(INaP), as indicated by recent experimental results. The neuron model accounts, with different\r\nparameter sets, for the diversity of firing patterns observed experimentally in both zero and normal\r\n[Ca2+]o. Increasing INaP in the neuron model induces bursting and increases the number of spikes\r\nwithin a burst, but is neither necessary nor sufficient for bursting. We show, using fast-slow analysis\r\nand bifurcation theory, that the M-type K+ current (IM) allows bursting by shifting neuronal behavior\r\nbetween a silent and a tonically-active state, provided the kinetics of the spike generating currents are\r\nsufficiently, though not extremely, fast. We suggest that bursting in CA1 pyramidal cells can be\r\nexplained by a single compartment *square bursting* mechanism with one slow variable, the\r\nactivation of IM.
