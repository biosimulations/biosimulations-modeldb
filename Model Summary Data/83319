The same networks are implemented in different simulators (NEURON, GENESIS, NEST, NCS, CSIM, XPP, SPLIT, MVAspike; there is also a couple of implementations in SciLab and C++).\r\nThe codes included in this package are benchmark simulations; see\r\nthe associated review paper (Brette et al. 2007). The \r\nmain goal is to provide a series of benchmark simulations of\r\nnetworks of spiking neurons, and demonstrate how these are implemented in the\r\ndifferent simulators overviewed in the paper.  See also details in the\r\nenclosed file Appendix2.pdf, which describes these different \r\nbenchmarks.  Some of these benchmarks were based on the \r\nVogels-Abbott model (Vogels TP and Abbott LF 2005).\r\n", "attr_id": 24}, "model_type": {"value": [{"object_id": 3536, "object_name": "Realistic Network"}], "attr_id": 112}, "model_concept": {"value": [{"object_id": 3543, "object_name": "Activity Patterns"}, {"object_id": 49304, "object_name": "Methods"}], "attr_id": 113}, "modeling_application": {"value": [{"object_id": 1882, "object_name": "NEURON"}, {"object_id": 1883, "object_name": "GENESIS"}, {"object_id": 2832, "object_name": "NEST"}, {"object_id": 3529, "object_name": "C or C++ program"}, {"object_id": 33977, "object_name": "XPP"}, {"object_id": 82383, "object_name": "CSIM"}, {"object_id": 83448, "object_name": "NCS"}, {"object_id": 83449, "object_name": "SPLIT"}, {"object_id": 83451, "object_name": "MVASpike"}, {"object_id": 83452, "object_name": "SciLab"}, {"object_id": 113733, "object_name": "Brian"}, {"object_id": 116010, "object_name": "PyNN"}, {"object_id": 114646, "object_name": "Python"}], "attr_id": 114}, "model_paper": {"value": [{"object_id": 58969, "object_name": "Vogels TP, Abbott LF (2005)"}, {"object_id": 83443, "object_name": "Brette R, Rudolph M, Carnevale T, Hines M, Beeman D, Bower JM, Diesmann M, Morrison A, Goodman PH, Harris FC, Zirpe M, Natschl\u00e4ger T, Pecevski D, Ermentrout B, Djurfeldt M, Lansner A, Rochel O, Vieville T, Muller E, Davison AP, El Boustani S, Destexhe A (2007)"}], "attr_id": 155}, "implemented_by": {"value": [{"object_id": 33735, "object_name": "Carnevale, Ted [Ted.Carnevale at Yale.edu]"}, {"object_id": 33736, "object_name": "Hines, Michael [Michael.Hines at Yale.edu]"}, {"object_id": 33739, "object_name": "Davison, Andrew [Andrew.Davison at iaf.cnrs-gif.fr]"}, {"object_id": 33744, "object_name": "Destexhe, Alain [Destexhe at iaf.cnrs-gif.fr]"}, {"object_id": 76884, "object_name": "Ermentrout, Bard [bard_at_pitt.edu]"}, {"object_id": 83453, "object_name": "Brette R"}, {"object_id": 83454, "object_name": "Bower, James"}, {"object_id": 83455, "object_name": "Beeman, Dave"}, {"object_id": 83456, "object_name": "Diesmann M"}, {"object_id": 83457, "object_name": "Morrison A "}, {"object_id": 83458, "object_name": "Goodman PH"}, {"object_id": 83459, "object_name": "Harris Jr, FC"}, {"object_id": 83460, "object_name": "Zirpe M "}, {"object_id": 83461, "object_name": "Natschlager T "}, {"object_id": 83462, "object_name": "Pecevski D "}, {"object_id": 83464, "object_name": "Djurfeldt M"}, {"object_id": 83465, "object_name": "Lansner, Anders [ala at kth.se]"}, {"object_id": 83466, "object_name": "Rochel O "}, {"object_id": 83467, "object_name": "Vieville T "}, {"object_id": 83468, "object_name": "Muller E "}, {"object_id": 83470, "object_name": "El Boustani, Sami  [elboustani at unic.cnrs-gif.fr]"}, {"object_id": 83471, "object_name": "Rudolph M "}], "attr_id": 299}, "other_neurons": {"value": "generic cortical neurons, integrate and fire, HH", "attr_id": 301}, "other_simulator": {"value": "many different simulators", "attr_id": 307}, "has_modelview": {"value": true, "attr_id": 502}, "hide_autolaunch_button": {"value": false, "attr_id": 582}, "gitrepo": false, "neurons": {"value": [{"object_id": 154740, "object_name": "Abstract integrate-and-fire leaky neuron"}], "attr_id": 414}}
