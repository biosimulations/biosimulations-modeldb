When an adaptive current is added, however, the f\u2013I curve is linearized, and low f occurs robustly over a large I range. Ermentrout (Neural Comput. 10(7):1721-1729, 1998) showed that this feature of adaptation paradoxically arises from the SNIC that is responsible for the vertical slope. We show, using a simplified Hindmarsh\u2013Rose neuron with negative feedback acting directly on the adaptation current, that whereas a SNIC contributes to linearization, in practice linearization over a large interval may require strong adaptation strength. We also find that a type 2 neuron with threshold generated by a Hopf bifurcation can also show linearization if adaptation strength is strong. Thus, a SNIC is not necessary. More fundamental than a SNIC is stretching the steep region near threshold, which stems from sufficiently strong adaptation, though a SNIC contributes if present. In a more realistic conductance-based model, Morris\u2013Lecar, with negative feedback acting on the adaptation conductance, an additional assumption that the driving force of the adaptation current is independent of I is needed. If this holds, strong adaptive conductance is both necessary and sufficient for linearization of f\u2013I curves of type 2 f\u2013I curves.\"", "attr_id": 24}, "currents": {"value": [{"object_id": 2396, "object_name": "I Calcium"}, {"object_id": 248, "object_name": "I K"}], "attr_id": 27}, "model_type": {"value": [{"object_id": 3537, "object_name": "Neuron or other electrically excitable cell"}], "attr_id": 112}, "model_concept": {"value": [{"object_id": 143724, "object_name": "Bifurcation"}], "attr_id": 113}, "modeling_application": {"value": [{"object_id": 33977, "object_name": "XPP"}], "attr_id": 114}, "model_paper": {"value": [{"object_id": 262614, "object_name": "Sherman AS, Ha J (2017)"}], "attr_id": 155}, "implemented_by": {"value": [{"object_id": 262615, "object_name": "Sherman, Arthur [arthurs at niddk.nih.gov]"}], "attr_id": 299}, "public_submitter_email": {"value": "tom.morse@yale.edu", "attr_id": 309}, "other_implementer": {"value": "Arthur Sherman", "attr_id": 308}, "citation": {"value": "https://mathematical-neuroscience.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13408-017-0047-3", "attr_id": 391}, "has_modelview": {"value": false, "attr_id": 502}, "hide_autolaunch_button": {"value": false, "attr_id": 582}, "gitrepo": true, "neurons": {"value": [{"object_id": 150222, "object_name": "Abstract Morris-Lecar neuron"}, {"object_id": 188553, "object_name": "Abstract Hindmarsh-Rose neuron"}], "attr_id": 414}}
