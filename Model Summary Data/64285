During spontaneous\r\nbursting of dopaminergic neurons in vivo, bursts related to reward\r\nexpectation in behaving animals, and bursts generated by dendritic\r\napplication of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) agonists, transient firing\r\nattains rates well above this range. We suggest a way such highfrequency\r\nfiring may occur in response to dendritic NMDA receptor\r\nactivation. We have extended the coupled oscillator model of the\r\ndopaminergic neuron, which represents the soma and dendrites as\r\nelectrically coupled compartments with different natural spiking frequencies,\r\nby addition of dendritic AMPA (voltage-independent) or\r\nNMDA (voltage-dependent) synaptic conductance. Both soma and\r\ndendrites contain a simplified version of the calcium-potassium mechanism\r\nknown to be the mechanism for slow spontaneous oscillation\r\nand background firing in dopaminergic cells.  We show that because of its voltage dependence,\r\nNMDA receptor activation acts to amplify the effect on the\r\nsoma of the high-frequency oscillation of the dendrites, which is\r\nnormally too weak to exert a large influence on the overall oscillation\r\nfrequency of the neuron.", "attr_id": 24}, "currents": {"value": [{"object_id": 253, "object_name": "I K,Ca"}, {"object_id": 2396, "object_name": "I Calcium"}], "attr_id": 27}, "receptors": {"value": [{"object_id": 205, "object_name": "AMPA"}, {"object_id": 206, "object_name": "NMDA"}], "attr_id": 26}, "model_type": {"value": [{"object_id": 3537, "object_name": "Neuron or other electrically excitable cell"}], "attr_id": 112}, "model_concept": {"value": [{"object_id": 3543, "object_name": "Activity Patterns"}, {"object_id": 3630, "object_name": "Bursting"}, {"object_id": 3634, "object_name": "Oscillations"}, {"object_id": 3649, "object_name": "Action Potentials"}], "attr_id": 113}, "modeling_application": {"value": [{"object_id": 33977, "object_name": "XPP"}], "attr_id": 114}, "model_paper": {"value": [{"object_id": 56008, "object_name": "Kuznetsov AS, Kopell NJ, Wilson CJ (2006)"}], "attr_id": 155}, "public_submitter_email": {"value": "tmm46@email.med.yale.edu", "attr_id": 309}, "gitrepo": false}
