These channels are regulated by intracellular ADP/ATP ratio and play a role in cellular metabolism. ... The objective of this study was to determine whether Diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) modifies K(ATP)-channel activity in pituitary GH(3) cells. ... Simulation studies also demonstrated that the increased conductance of K(ATP)-channels used to mimic DEPC actions reduced the frequency of spontaneous action potentials and fluctuation of intracellular Ca(2+). The results indicate that chemical modification with DEPC enhances K(ATP)-channel activity and influences functional activities of pituitary GH(3) cells.
