The shape of the somatic PRC is an important determinant of collective network dynamics. Here we study theoretically and experimentally the impact of distally-located synapses and dendritic nonlinearities on the synchronization properties of rhythmically firing neurons. Combining the theories of quasi-active cables and phase-coupled oscillators we derive an approximation for the dendritic responsiveness, captured by the neuron's dendritic PRC (dPRC). This closed-form expression indicates that the dPRCs are linearly-filtered versions of the somatic PRC, and that the filter characteristics are determined by the passive and active properties of the dendrite. ... collective dynamics can be qualitatively different depending on the location of the synapse, the neuronal firing rates and the dendritic nonlinearities.\" See paper for more and details.", "attr_id": 24}, "model_type": {"value": [{"object_id": 3537, "object_name": "Neuron or other electrically excitable cell"}], "attr_id": 112}, "model_concept": {"value": [{"object_id": 3635, "object_name": "Synchronization"}, {"object_id": 64174, "object_name": "Synaptic Integration"}, {"object_id": 137847, "object_name": "Phase Response Curves"}], "attr_id": 113}, "modeling_application": {"value": [{"object_id": 33977, "object_name": "XPP"}], "attr_id": 114}, "model_paper": {"value": [{"object_id": 83212, "object_name": "Goldberg JA, Deister CA, Wilson CJ (2007)"}], "attr_id": 155}, "implemented_by": {"value": [{"object_id": 83567, "object_name": "Goldberg, Joshua [JoshG at ekmd.huji.ac.il]"}], "attr_id": 299}, "public_submitter_email": {"value": "tom.morse@yale.edu", "attr_id": 309}, "citation": {"value": "Goldberg JA, Deister CA, Wilson CJ (2006)", "attr_id": 391}, "gitrepo": false}
