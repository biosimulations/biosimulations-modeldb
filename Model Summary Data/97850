The model by Rubin and Terman [31] represents one of the most comprehensive and biologically plausible models of DBS published recently. We examined the validity of the model, replicated its simulations and tested its robustness. While our simulations partially reproduced the results presented by Rubin and Terman [31], several issues were raised including the high complexity of the model in its non simplified form, the lack of robustness of the model with respect to small perturbations, the nonrealistic representation of the thalamus and the absence of time delays. Computational models are indeed necessary, but they may not be sufficient in their current forms to explain the effect of chronic electrical stimulation on the activity of the basal ganglia (BG) network in PD.\"", "attr_id": 24}, "neurons": {"value": [{"object_id": 262, "object_name": "Thalamus geniculate nucleus/lateral principal GLU cell"}, {"object_id": 74300, "object_name": "Subthalamus nucleus projection neuron"}, {"object_id": 88217, "object_name": "Globus pallidus neuron"}], "attr_id": 25}, "currents": {"value": [{"object_id": 242, "object_name": "I Na,t"}, {"object_id": 243, "object_name": "I L high threshold"}, {"object_id": 245, "object_name": "I T low threshold"}, {"object_id": 248, "object_name": "I K"}, {"object_id": 2396, "object_name": "I Calcium"}], "attr_id": 27}, "model_type": {"value": [{"object_id": 3536, "object_name": "Realistic Network"}], "attr_id": 112}, "model_concept": {"value": [{"object_id": 3543, "object_name": "Activity Patterns"}, {"object_id": 65417, "object_name": "Parkinson's"}, {"object_id": 116944, "object_name": "Deep brain stimulation"}], "attr_id": 113}, "modeling_application": {"value": [{"object_id": 33977, "object_name": "XPP"}], "attr_id": 114}, "model_paper": {"value": [{"object_id": 95257, "object_name": "Pascual A, Modolo J, Beuter A (2006)"}], "attr_id": 155}, "region": {"value": [{"object_id": 115952, "object_name": "Basal ganglia"}], "attr_id": 471}, "public_submitter_email": {"value": "tom.morse@yale.edu", "attr_id": 309}, "citation": {"value": "Pascual A, Modolo J, Beuter A (2006) Is a computational model useful to\r\nunderstand the effect of deep brain stimulation in Parkinson's disease?\r\nJ Integr Neurosci 5:541-59", "attr_id": 391}, "gitrepo": false}
