To elucidate the nature of\r\nthis ongoing activity, we present a theoretical treatment of two contrasting scenarios of cortical dynamics: (1) fluctuations about a single background state\r\nand (2) wandering among multiple \u201cattractor\u201d states, which\r\nencode a single or several stimulus features.\r\nStudying simplified network rate models of the primary\r\nvisual cortex (V1), we show that the single state scenario\r\nis characterized by fast and high-dimensional\r\nGaussian-like fluctuations, whereas in the multiple\r\nstate scenario the fluctuations are slow, low dimensional,\r\nand highly non-Gaussian. Studying a more realistic model that incorporates correlations in the feedforward input, spatially restricted cortical interactions,\r\nand an experimentally derived layout of pinwheels,\r\nwe show that recent optical-imaging data of ongoing\r\nactivity in V1 are consistent with the presence of either\r\na single background state or multiple attractor states\r\nencoding many features.", "attr_id": 24}, "model_type": {"value": [{"object_id": 83551, "object_name": "Connectionist Network"}], "attr_id": 112}, "model_concept": {"value": [{"object_id": 3636, "object_name": "Spatio-temporal Activity Patterns"}, {"object_id": 58584, "object_name": "Rate-coding model neurons"}, {"object_id": 245690, "object_name": "Olfaction"}], "attr_id": 113}, "modeling_application": {"value": [{"object_id": 33977, "object_name": "XPP"}], "attr_id": 114}, "model_paper": {"value": [{"object_id": 72561, "object_name": "Goldberg JA, Rokni U, Sompolinsky H (2004)"}], "attr_id": 155}, "implemented_by": {"value": [{"object_id": 83567, "object_name": "Goldberg, Joshua [JoshG at ekmd.huji.ac.il]"}], "attr_id": 299}, "public_submitter_email": {"value": "tom.morse@yale.edu", "attr_id": 309}, "has_modelview": {"value": false, "attr_id": 502}, "hide_autolaunch_button": {"value": false, "attr_id": 582}, "gitrepo": false}
