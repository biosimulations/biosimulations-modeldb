A frozen Gaussian noise current, superimposed on a DC current, was injected. The neuron responded with spike trains that showed trial-to-trial variability. The reliability depends on the shape (steepness) of the current input versus spike frequency output curve. The model also allowed to study the contribution of three relevant ionic membrane currents to reliability: a T-type calcium current, a cation selective h-current and a calcium dependent potassium current in order to allow bursting, investigate the consequences of a more complex current-frequency relation and produce realistic firing rates.", "attr_id": 24}, "currents": {"value": [{"object_id": 242, "object_name": "I Na,t"}, {"object_id": 245, "object_name": "I T low threshold"}, {"object_id": 248, "object_name": "I K"}, {"object_id": 251, "object_name": "I h"}, {"object_id": 127083, "object_name": "I_AHP"}], "attr_id": 27}, "model_type": {"value": [{"object_id": 3537, "object_name": "Neuron or other electrically excitable cell"}], "attr_id": 112}, "model_concept": {"value": [{"object_id": 3630, "object_name": "Bursting"}, {"object_id": 150219, "object_name": "Reliability"}], "attr_id": 113}, "modeling_application": {"value": [{"object_id": 33977, "object_name": "XPP"}, {"object_id": 36835, "object_name": "MATLAB"}], "attr_id": 114}, "model_paper": {"value": [{"object_id": 150221, "object_name": "Zeldenrust F, Chameau PJ, Wadman WJ (2013)"}], "attr_id": 155}, "implemented_by": {"value": [{"object_id": 150218, "object_name": "Zeldenrust, Fleur [fleurzeldenrust at gmail.com]"}], "attr_id": 299}, "public_submitter_email": {"value": "fleurzeldenrust@gmail.com", "attr_id": 309}, "other_neurons": {"value": "Morris-Lecar neuron", "attr_id": 301}, "other_concept": {"value": "Reliability", "attr_id": 306}, "other_implementer": {"value": "Zeldenrust, Fleur <fleurzeldenrust@gmail.com>", "attr_id": 308}, "citation": {"value": "PMID: 23708878", "attr_id": 391}, "has_modelview": {"value": false, "attr_id": 502}, "gitrepo": false, "neurons": {"value": [{"object_id": 150222, "object_name": "Abstract Morris-Lecar neuron"}], "attr_id": 414}}
