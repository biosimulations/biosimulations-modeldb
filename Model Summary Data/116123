With phase plane and bifurcation analysis, each class of excitability was shown to derive from distinct spike initiating dynamics. \r\n\r\nExcitability could be converted between all three classes by varying single parameters; moreover, several\r\nparameters, when varied one at a time, had functionally equivalent effects on excitability. From this, we conclude that the\r\nspike-initiating dynamics associated with each of Hodgkin\u2019s classes represent different outcomes in a nonlinear competition\r\nbetween oppositely directed, kinetically mismatched currents. ...\"", "attr_id": 24}, "model_type": {"value": [{"object_id": 3537, "object_name": "Neuron or other electrically excitable cell"}], "attr_id": 112}, "model_concept": {"value": [{"object_id": 3541, "object_name": "Action Potential Initiation"}, {"object_id": 3638, "object_name": "Simplified Models"}, {"object_id": 143724, "object_name": "Bifurcation"}, {"object_id": 182362, "object_name": "Sensory coding"}], "attr_id": 113}, "modeling_application": {"value": [{"object_id": 33977, "object_name": "XPP"}], "attr_id": 114}, "model_paper": {"value": [{"object_id": 116122, "object_name": "Prescott SA, De Koninck Y, Sejnowski TJ (2008)"}], "attr_id": 155}, "implemented_by": {"value": [{"object_id": 53570, "object_name": "Prescott, Steven [steve.prescott at sickkids.ca]]"}], "attr_id": 299}, "has_modelview": {"value": false, "attr_id": 502}, "gitrepo": false, "neurons": {"value": [{"object_id": 150222, "object_name": "Abstract Morris-Lecar neuron"}], "attr_id": 414}}
