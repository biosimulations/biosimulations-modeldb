Some neurons can store information for short periods (seconds to minutes) by continuing to spike after a stimulus ends, thus enabling working memory. This so-called \u201cpersistent\u201d spiking occurs in many brain areas and has been linked to activation of canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) channels. However, TRPC activation alone is insufficient to explain many aspects of persistent spiking such as resumption of spiking after periods of imposed quiescence. Using experiments and simulations, we show that calcium influx caused by spiking is necessary and sufficient to activate TRPC channels and that the ensuing positive feedback interaction between intracellular calcium and TRPC channel activation can account for many hitherto unexplained aspects of persistent spiking.\"", "attr_id": 24}, "currents": {"value": [{"object_id": 255, "object_name": "I CAN"}, {"object_id": 127083, "object_name": "I_AHP"}, {"object_id": 242, "object_name": "I Na,t"}, {"object_id": 248, "object_name": "I K"}], "attr_id": 27}, "model_type": {"value": [{"object_id": 3537, "object_name": "Neuron or other electrically excitable cell"}], "attr_id": 112}, "model_concept": {"value": [{"object_id": 98012, "object_name": "Calcium dynamics"}, {"object_id": 3649, "object_name": "Action Potentials"}, {"object_id": 82787, "object_name": "Working memory"}, {"object_id": 185343, "object_name": "Persistent activity"}], "attr_id": 113}, "modeling_application": {"value": [{"object_id": 33977, "object_name": "XPP"}], "attr_id": 114}, "model_paper": {"value": [{"object_id": 253999, "object_name": "Ratt\u00e9 S, Karnup S, Prescott SA (2018)"}], "attr_id": 155}, "implemented_by": {"value": [{"object_id": 53570, "object_name": "Prescott, Steven [steve.prescott at sickkids.ca]]"}], "attr_id": 299}, "public_submitter_email": {"value": "tom.morse@yale.edu", "attr_id": 309}, "other_neurons": {"value": "ACC neuron", "attr_id": 301}, "citation": {"value": "Ratte et al 2018", "attr_id": 391}, "has_modelview": {"value": false, "attr_id": 502}, "hide_autolaunch_button": {"value": false, "attr_id": 582}, "gitrepo": false}
