Using a computational model, this paper considers the hypothesis that DBS works by replacing pathologically rhythmic\r\nbasal ganglia output with tonic, high frequency firing.\r\n\r\nIn our simulations of parkinsonian conditions, rhythmic inhibition from GPi to the thalamus compromises the ability of thalamocortical relay (TC) cells to respond to depolarizing inputs, such as sensorimotor signals.\r\n\r\nHigh frequency stimulation of STN regularizes GPi firing, and this restores TC responsiveness, despite the increased frequency and amplitude of GPi inhibition to thalamus that result.\r\n\r\nWe provide a mathematical phase plane analysis of the mechanisms that determine TC relay capabilities in\r\nnormal, parkinsonian, and DBS states in a reduced model.\r\n\r\nThis analysis highlights the differences in deinactivation of the low-threshold calcium T -current that we observe in TC cells in these different conditions. ...\"\r\n", "attr_id": 24}, "neurons": {"value": [{"object_id": 262, "object_name": "Thalamus geniculate nucleus/lateral principal GLU cell"}, {"object_id": 74300, "object_name": "Subthalamus nucleus projection neuron"}, {"object_id": 88217, "object_name": "Globus pallidus neuron"}], "attr_id": 25}, "currents": {"value": [{"object_id": 242, "object_name": "I Na,t"}, {"object_id": 245, "object_name": "I T low threshold"}, {"object_id": 248, "object_name": "I K"}, {"object_id": 2396, "object_name": "I Calcium"}], "attr_id": 27}, "model_type": {"value": [{"object_id": 3536, "object_name": "Realistic Network"}, {"object_id": 3537, "object_name": "Neuron or other electrically excitable cell"}], "attr_id": 112}, "model_concept": {"value": [{"object_id": 3543, "object_name": "Activity Patterns"}, {"object_id": 65417, "object_name": "Parkinson's"}, {"object_id": 116944, "object_name": "Deep brain stimulation"}], "attr_id": 113}, "modeling_application": {"value": [{"object_id": 33977, "object_name": "XPP"}], "attr_id": 114}, "model_paper": {"value": [{"object_id": 49493, "object_name": "Rubin JE, Terman D (2004)"}], "attr_id": 155}, "region": {"value": [{"object_id": 115951, "object_name": "Thalamus"}, {"object_id": 115952, "object_name": "Basal ganglia"}, {"object_id": 116868, "object_name": "Subthalamic Nucleus"}], "attr_id": 471}, "gitrepo": false}
